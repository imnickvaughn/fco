If so, you are not alone. While the two are undoubtedly connected, there are minute differences between the two. As a business owner it is essential that you understand branding and marketing both in great detail, so that you can effectively utilize them together. Below is a closer look at the differences between marketing and branding.\r\n<h2><strong>What Is Branding?</strong></h2>\r\nIn a nutshell, branding is who you areâand marketing is how you build awareness. Branding is your strategy, while marketing encompasses your tactical goals. In order to determine who your brand is, you need to ask yourself several questions. Questions that go beyond industry generalizations, and services or products offered and also questions to determine who your are as a company, and more importantly, who you are as a brand. The questions below are an excellent place to begin:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>What are your core principles and values?</li>\r\n 	<li>What is your mission statement?</li>\r\n 	<li>What inspired you to build your business?</li>\r\n 	<li>Why do you want to offer your products or services to your target audience?</li>\r\n 	<li>What makes you unique?</li>\r\n 	<li>What is your internal company culture?</li>\r\n 	<li>What is your professional sense of style?</li>\r\n 	<li>What are your communication characteristics?</li>\r\n 	<li>What do you want to come to mind when someone hears your business name?</li>\r\n 	<li>How do you want people to feel when they think of your business?</li>\r\n 	<li>How do you want customers to describe you as a company?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAnswering the questions above will help you to understand the difference between branding and marketing. Invest your time in providing elaborate answers, and bounce them off your colleagues and professional mentors. What you will notice, is that all of the questions are related to your internal operations and your internal culture. Therefore, what you build on the inside, is what will emanate externally.\r\n\r\nYour branding will cultivate what your consumers can expect of you, and what they will experience when they utilize your products or services. By clearly defining who you are, your branding can then be utilized to precede and underlie your marketing effortsâboth today and for years to come.\r\n<h2><strong>What Is Marketing?</strong></h2>\r\nWhen speaking of marketing vs. branding, marketing refers to the tools you utilize to deliver the message of your brand. Marketing will continually change and evolve, just as the products and services you offer will continue to change and evolve. Marketing will be directly and specifically geared towards sectors of your target audience, all while supporting the core values of your brand.\r\n\r\nMarketing is vast and wide. It can be heartfelt, funny, or serious. It can be any mix of text, keywords, photos, charts, graphs, and videos. Marketing will be performed by a variety of online and offline methodsâsome of the most common being:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>SEO</li>\r\n 	<li>Content Marketing</li>\r\n 	<li>Social Media Marketing</li>\r\n 	<li>Pay Per Click Marketing</li>\r\n 	<li>Mobile Marketing</li>\r\n 	<li>Television</li>\r\n 	<li>Radio</li>\r\n 	<li>Print Campaigns</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nHowever, there are many other methods of both online and offline marketing for you to consider working into your marketing campaign. While marketing methods will come and go, and the methods you utilize may change drastically from year-to-year, or from season-to-seasonâyour brand will always remain a constant.\r\n<h2><strong>Which Comes FirstâMarketing Or Branding?</strong></h2>\r\nBranding is at the core of your marketing strategy, so branding must come first. Even if you are a start up, it is essential to clearly define who you are as a brandâbefore you begin to devise your specific marketing methods, tools, strategies, and tactics.\r\nYour brand is what will keep your clients coming back for more, it is the foundation upon which you will build consumer loyalty. Think of restaurants and retailers in your local area (independently owned, or major corporations), it is the brand that keeps customers coming back generation after generation. As an example, consider where you order and pick up prescriptions for yourself and your family. Whether the pharmacy or drugstore you shop in is locally owned, or part of a larger chainâthey have built your trust and your loyalty, and you have most likely been a customer with them for many years. While you can purchase the exact same prescriptions at any other pharmacy in town, it is their branding that keeps you coming back time and time again.\r\nWhile marketing methods will evolve, and respond to current industry and cultural trendsâbranding remains the same. Even if you make adjustments to your brand, they will typically be in response to your growth or expanded services offeredâbut is rarely an overhaul of your core principals, mission, or values.\r\n\r\nYour branding includes attributes such as a high commitment to quality, community, convenience, communicationâor an ongoing commitment to a specific need your target audience needs fulfilled.\r\n\r\nAlso keep in mind that branding is something you and your team must do on a daily basis, and with every transaction processed, with every phone call received, and email responded to. However, your marketing is most often partially or fully outsourced to marketing professionals. When speaking of branding vs. marketing, branding is who you areâwhile marketing is how you attract consumer attention. Also think of branding as the way you keep current clients, and marketing as how you attract new clients.\r\n<h2><strong>The One Area Branding And Marketing Overlap</strong></h2>\r\nWhile branding and marketing are distinctly different, there is one area where they overlap. When selecting imagery to be utilize on an ongoing basis, branding and marketing become one in the same. As the saying goes âA picture speaks a thousand words.â With that in mind, when you choose your company colors, graphics, and logoâremember that they must first represent your brandâbut that they will also play a substantial role in your ongoing marketing campaign.\r\n<h2><strong>The Importance Of Understanding Branding vs. Marketing</strong></h2>\r\nIf the difference between marketing and branding are now clear, but you are still unsure of the importance of understanding the twoâit all comes down to conversions. While you could create your marketing strategies with nothing other than keyword trends, and the most effective marketing methods within your industryâyour conversions will be lower if your consumers are not connected to you as a brand.\r\n\r\nYour branding is what generates a timeless connection. Even if your current marketing efforts are designed to engage, it is the ongoing branding that keeps customers coming back. Competition is fierce, and the fact of the matter is that there are companies who offer comparable products and servicesâor even the exact same products and services that you offer. It is your branding that will keep your customers returning for more. It is your branding that builds loyalty and trust. It is your branding that makes you unique.\r\n\r\nWithout branding you may achieve success, but with branding your success will be far more substantial. All strong structures have a solid starting point and foundation, and understanding the difference between marketing and branding will allow you to build your foundation of brandingâand your extensions via marketing.','Branding vs. Marketing','','publish','closed','open','','branding-vs-marketing','','','2017-08-14 22:32:28','2017-08-14 22:32:28','',0,'http://www.localhost/allsoftbear/?p=208',0,'post','',0),(211,1,'2017-07-27 20:53:52','2017-07-27 20:53:52','','Branding_vs_Marketing','','inherit','open','closed','','branding_vs_marketing','','','2017-07-27 20:53:52','2017-07-27 20:53:52','',208,'http://www.localhost/allsoftbear/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Branding_vs_Marketing.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(213,1,'2017-07-24 21:27:17','2017-07-24 21:27:17','<h2 id=\"d9a7\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3 graf--subtitle\">Or âstop judging someoneâs portfolio before knowing their objectivesâ.</h2>\r\n<p id=\"a617\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Should design portfolios be straightforward and focused on the work, or should they be a piece of art that showcases the designerâs capabilities and vision? Is this even a binary question in the first place?</p>\r\nBrowsing through my feeds the other day I come across the following discussion:\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-216\" src=\"http://www.localhost/allsoftbear/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/1-chMYyQsyqEdKcmXmLUwShw.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"744\" height=\"452\" />\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p id=\"b5f6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">If you are not familiar with the portfolio shared in the discussion above, hereâs a screencast to give you a bit more context and theÂ <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"http://narrowdesign.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-href=\"http://narrowdesign.com/\">link</a>Â so you can test it yourself:</p>\r\n\r\n<figure id=\"a0ed\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\">\r\n<div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\">\r\n<div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image is-canvasLoaded is-imageLoaded\" data-image-id=\"1*a9FAjhl5jl5WFc0orJXQuw.gif\" data-width=\"1433\" data-height=\"750\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*a9FAjhl5jl5WFc0orJXQuw.gif\" data-scroll=\"native\"><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\" width=\"75\" height=\"38\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-zoom js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*a9FAjhl5jl5WFc0orJXQuw.gif\" /></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Have you seen this portfolio recently?</figcaption></figure>\r\n<blockquote>You can probably guess what followed: a long, heated discussion aboutÂ <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pullquote-strong\">usability versus creativity</strong>,Â <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pullquote-strong\">form versus function</strong>,Â <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pullquote-strong\">performance versus beauty</strong>,Â <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pullquote-strong\">contrast versus legibility</strong>, republican versus democrat,Â <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pullquote-strong\">mine versusÂ yours</strong>.</blockquote>\r\n<p id=\"5ba0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\">But thatâs what happens with most discussions online: they quickly become about polarization, and people thinking in a pretty binary fashion about what they consider to be correct or incorrect. Donât get me wrong:Â <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">the participants of the discussion are not to blame at all</strong>. The reality is that short-form online discussions like the one above can only go so deep in terms of understanding all the complexities of a design decision.</p>\r\n<p id=\"b9b6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Halfway through reading all the comments in that thread, my eyes start to space out. I couldnât avoid stepping back and asking myself â<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">but hey, what is the real role of a design portfolio in the first place?</strong>â. Until the people engaging in that discussion donât align on what a portfolioâs objectives are, they wonât have any fruitful conclusions coming out of it.</p>\r\n<p id=\"27bc\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">So letâs do here one of the things I enjoy the most: to break down problems into smaller pieces, until they become more manageable to solve or answer.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure id=\"829f\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\">\r\n<div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\">\r\n<div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></div>\r\n<img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*aNPBhln7iDMY8qRcmoyCfA.jpeg\" data-image-id=\"1*aNPBhln7iDMY8qRcmoyCfA.jpeg\" data-width=\"700\" data-height=\"18\" data-pin-nopin=\"true\" />\r\n\r\n</div></figure>\r\n<h3 id=\"8c0c\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure\">Question 1: what is the role of a designerâs portfolio?</h3>\r\n<p id=\"bcaa\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">First step is to understand all the possible angles to defining the role of a portfolio:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"postList\">\r\n 	<li id=\"bb08\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">Is it to show the final output of the projects the designer has worked on?Â </strong>If this is the case, the design of the portfolio itself should be as simple as possible, focused on the content rather than the form. Expect big, full-bleed images beautifully crafted to create visual impact. Thatâs what platforms like cargocollective, behance and squarespace focus on.</li>\r\n 	<li id=\"5bc4\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">Is it to demonstrate the designerâs thought process?</strong>Â In this case, expect project pages with much more writing, behind-the-scenes deliverables and long-form explanation.</li>\r\n 	<li id=\"a0f2\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">Is it to be a piece of art in itself, that showcases the designerâs vision?Â </strong>In these cases the portfolio itself is the way the designer has found to demonstrate their design skills and vision, without all the constraints that projects sponsored by clients usually have. It shows to the world their vision on what good design is, in its purest form. In the example shown above,Â <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--li-anchor\" href=\"http://narrowdesign.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-href=\"http://narrowdesign.com\">narrowdesign.com</a>, the portfolio homepage is showcasing the designerâs knowledge on design theory (golden ratio rule), their craft on motion design and animation, their great taste for color palettesâââand much more.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p id=\"2181\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">The options above are not mutually exclusive, though. While some people will say âall of the aboveâ, having a clear focus can help your portfolio achieve its goal more effectively. But in order to really understand in which of the three areas your portfolio should focus on, you have to ask yourself another question.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure id=\"c46c\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\">\r\n<div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\">\r\n<div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></div>\r\n<img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*aNPBhln7iDMY8qRcmoyCfA.jpeg\" data-image-id=\"1*aNPBhln7iDMY8qRcmoyCfA.jpeg\" data-width=\"700\" data-height=\"18\" />\r\n\r\n</div></figure>\r\n<h3 id=\"e319\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure\">Question 2: what is the designerâs objective?</h3>\r\n<ul class=\"postList\">\r\n 	<li id=\"b3a9\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--h3\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">Is it to document their past work?</strong>Â Some people update their portfolio simply because they donât want to lose track of the projects they have worked on. There isnât any secret agenda here: they are just looking to build a repository of past work that they can easily refer to in the future. A memoir.</li>\r\n 	<li id=\"fdd1\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">Is it finding a new job?</strong>Â Is the designer actively looking for a new job? If thatâs the case, with which type of company are they looking to engage? A design studio? An agency? A business consultancy? Client-side? Product-focused? What is the type of project recruiters and managers will be looking for?</li>\r\n 	<li id=\"841e\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">Is it to be seen as a specialist in a certain area?</strong>Â Some people redesign their portfolio website as a way to position themselves professionally in a slightly different manner than they have been doing. Itâs that good old saying: âput the work you want to be doing in your portfolio, not the work you think others want to seeâ. And that might be the case for some designers, depending on where they are in their careers.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p id=\"32aa\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">Simple, right?</p>\r\n<p id=\"643c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Not really.

While syndication feeds have become a standard tool on the Web--you\'ve seen their signposts: a little orange button labeled XML in white letters, or maybe buttons that say Atom, RSS 2.0, RSS 1.0, or even Feed--it is important that your syndication feed be an extension of your site. It should reflect your interests, your concerns, and your choices. This edoc will help you learn about these pervasive little blobs of XML markup: their purpose, the elements that make up a feed, the different formats, and the tools for generating and consuming feeds.The tutorial starts with a succinct description of what a feed really is, then it covers:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>What Makes Up a Feed: A look at the common container and entry elements for a feed, and what they do.</li>\r\n 	<li>Industry Support: An overview of the major players and tools for syndication feeds.</li>\r\n 	<li>Discovering Feeds: How to make your site easy to subscribe to.</li>\r\n 	<li>Subscribing To and Reading Feeds: A look at various aggregators and how to use them.</li>\r\n 	<li>Which Feeds Work Best for You: Should you use RSS 1.0, RSS 2.0, or Atom? Or all of them? Here\'s how to decide.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThis tutorial will help you get your syndication feed up and running, so you can then forget about it and focus instead on what\'s really important at your site: the content you are providing to the world.\r\n\r\n</section>','What Are Syndication Feeds','','pending','open','closed','','what-are-syndication-feeds','','','2017-08-09 19:21:29','2017-08-09

major types of marketing strategies. The first is known as mass marketing or âbrandingâ.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this type of advertising is to remind customers and prospects about your brand as well as the products and services you offer.\r\n\r\nThe idea is that the more times you run ads from your brand, the more likely people are to have this brand at the top of their consciousness when they go to make a purchasing decision.\r\n\r\nIf youâve seen the ads from major brands such as Coca Cola, Nike and Apple youâll have experienced âimageâ marketing.\r\n\r\nThe vast majority of advertising falls into this category.\r\n\r\nThereâs no doubt that this type of marketing is effective, however it is very expensive to successfully pull off and takes a lot of time.\r\n\r\nIt requires you to saturate various types of advertising media e.g. TV, print, radio, Internet etc. on a very regular basis and over an extended period of time.\r\n\r\nThe expense and time involved are not a problem for the major brands as they have massive advertising budgets and product lines are planned years in advance.\r\n\r\nHowever, a problem arises when small businesses try to imitate the big brands at this type of marketing.\r\n\r\nThe few times they run their ads is like a drop in the ocean. Itâs nowhere near enough to reach the consciousness of their target market who are bombarded with thousands of marketing messages each day.\r\n\r\nSo they get drowned out and see little or no return for their investment.\r\n\r\nAnother advertising victim bites the dust.\r\n\r\nItâs not that the small businesses arenât good âbrandingâ or mass media ads. Itâs that they simply donât have the budget to run their ads in sufficient volume to make them effective.\r\n\r\nUnless you have millions of dollars in your marketing budget, you have a very high probability of failure with this type of marketing.\r\n<h2>Direct Response Marketing</h2>\r\nThe second type of marketing strategy is called âdirect responseâ.\r\n\r\nDirect response marketing, is designed to evoke an immediate response and compel prospects to take some specific action, such as opting in to your email list, picking up the phone and calling for more information, placing an order or being directed to a web page.\r\n\r\nSo what makes a direct response ad? Here are some of the main characteristics:\r\n\r\n<strong>Itâs trackable.</strong>Â That is, when someone responds, you know which ad and which media was responsible for generating the response. This is in direct contrast to mass media or âbrandâ marketing â no one will ever know what ad compelled you to buy that can of Coke, heck you may not even know yourself.\r\n\r\n<strong>Itâs measurable.</strong>Â Since you know which ads are being responded to and how many sales youâve received from each one, you can measure exactly how effective each ad is. You then drop or change ads that are not giving you a return on investment.\r\n\r\n<strong>It uses compelling headlines and sales copy.</strong>Â Direct response marketing has a compelling message of strong interest to your chosen prospects. It uses attention grabbing headlines with strong sales copy that is âsalesmanship in printâ. Often the ad looks more like editorial than an ad (hence making it at least three times more likely to get read).\r\n\r\n<strong>It targets a specific audience or niche.</strong>Â Prospects within specific verticals, geographic zones or niche markets are targeted. The ad aims to appeal to a narrow target market.\r\n\r\n<strong>It makes a specific offer.</strong>Â Usually the ad makes a specific value-packed offer. Often the aim is not necessarily to sell anything from the ad but to simply get the prospect to take the next action, such as requesting a free report.\r\n\r\nThe offer focuses on the prospect rather than on the advertiser and talks about the prospectâs interests, desires, fears and frustrations.\r\n\r\nBy contrast mass media or âbrandâ marketing has a broad, one size fits all marketing message and is focused on the advertiser.\r\n\r\n<strong>It demands a response.</strong>Â Direct response advertising has a âcall to actionâ, compelling the prospect to do something specific. It also includes a means of response and âcaptureâ of these responses.\r\n\r\nInterested, high probability prospects have easy ways to respond such as a regular phone number, a free recorded message line, a web site, a fax back form, a reply card or coupons.\r\n\r\nWhen the prospect responds, as much of the personâs contact information as possible is captured so that they can be contacted beyond the initial response.\r\n\r\n<strong>Multi-step, short term follow-up.</strong>Â In exchange for capturing the prospectâs details, valuable education and information on the prospectâs problem is offered. The information should carry with it a second âirresistible offerâ â tied to whatever next step you want to prospect to take, such as calling to schedule an appointment or coming into the showroom or store. Then a series of follow-up âtouchesâ via different media such as mail, e-mail, fax, phone are made. Often there is a time or quantity limit on the offer.\r\n\r\n<strong>Maintenance follow-up of unconverted leads.</strong>Â People who do not respond within the short term follow-up period may have many reasons for not âmaturingâ into buyers immediately. There is value in this bank of slow-to-mature prospects. They should continue hearing from you once to several times a month.\r\n<h2>Money At A Discount</h2>\r\nDirect response marketing is a highly ethical way of selling. Itâs focused on the specific problems of the prospect and aims to solve these problems with education and specific solutions.\r\n\r\nIt is also the only real way for a small business to affordably reach the consciousness of a prospect.\r\n\r\nYour marketing system must deliver profitable results.\r\n\r\nYou have to know what a customer is worth to you, and then decide what you are reasonably willing to invest to acquire one, and then build systems that work within that limit.\r\n\r\nDirect response is an accountable way to run marketing for a small business, as it is highly focused on return on investment.\r\n\r\nIf $10 bills were being sold for $2 each, how many would you buy?\r\n\r\nThe name of the game with direct response marketing is âmoney at a discountâ e.g. $2 into advertising to get $10 out in the way of profits from sales.\r\n\r\nWhen you turn your ads into direct response ads, they become lead generating tools rather than just name recognition tools.','What Is Direct Response Marketing?','','publish','open','open','','what-is-direct-response-marketing','','','2017-08-14 22:23:58','2017-08-14 22:23:58','',0,'http://www.localhost/fco/?p=409',0,'post','',0),(410,1,'2017-08-05 02:11:07','2017-08-05 02:11:07','','post-bullseye','','inherit','open','closed','','post-bullseye','','','2017-08-05 02:11:07','2017-08-05 02:11:07','',409,'http://www.localhost/fco/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/post-bullseye.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(412,1,'2017-07-30 02:34:26','2017-07-30 02:34:26','Many new businesses take the approach of expecting sales to happen by the mere fact that they exist.\r\n\r\nSome open a physical store, others open a website and expect sales to just start rolling in.\r\n\r\nTheir marketing strategy is hope.\r\n\r\nAnd sure they may make a small number of sales just by virtue of being there when a random prospect wanders by. But that is a guaranteed path to frustration.\r\n\r\nMany such businesses make just enough in sales to torture themselves to death. They then conclude the market or their industry is too competitive.\r\n\r\nTruth be told, I donât know of any market or industry that is not competitive. But one thing I know for certain is that in any market or industry you look at, no matter how competitive, thereâll be someone doing really well and thereâll be someone struggling.\r\n\r\nSo if we were honest with ourselves we couldnât really believe it to be a problem with the market or industry.\r\n\r\nSo whatâs the problem?\r\n<h2>The âme tooâ Problem</h2>\r\nThe problem is likely that youâre positioning yourself as a commodity, a âme tooâ type of business.\r\n\r\nWhen you position yourself in this way youâre only marketing weapons are to shout as loudly as possible (which is very expensive) or to discount your prices as far as possible (which is dangerous).\r\n\r\nUnless you are a Costco, Walmart or other such behemoth, you really donât want price to be your key differentiator, as thatâs a battle you wonât win.\r\n\r\nAt this stage many businesses realise their folly and start making dubious and unquantifiable claims like being âthe bestâ, âthe highest qualityâ etc.\r\n<h2>Two Questions To Keep Asking Yourself</h2>\r\nThere are two questions I ask myself and my clients today.\r\n\r\nAnswering these two questions is the path towards financial success in business.\r\n\r\nIn fact I would argue not answering these questions is the reason why 96% of businesses fail in the first 10 years.\r\n\r\nSo the two questions you must ask and answer are:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Why should they buy?</li>\r\n 	<li>Why should they buy from me?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese are questions that should have clear, concise and quantifiable answers. Not wishy washy nonsense like âwe are the bestâ or âwe have the highest qualityâ.\r\n\r\nWhat is the unique advantage you are offering?\r\n\r\nNow the uniqueness doesnât have to be in the product itself. In fact it would be fair to say that there are very few truly unique products.\r\n\r\nThe uniqueness may be in the way it is packaged, delivered, supported or even sold.\r\n\r\nYou need to position what you do in such a way that even if your competitor was operating directly opposite you, customers would cross the road to do business with you instead of your competitor.\r\n\r\nDo it really well and they may even stand in line overnight to do business with you instead of your competitor, like they do with Apple products.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter frame\" src=\"http://successwise.com/assets/images/apple-store-queue.jpg\" alt=\"Apple Store Queue\" />\r\n\r\nApple â One of the most incredible marketing companies in the world\r\n<h2>Put in terms your prospect can easily understand</h2>\r\nYour prospect has essentially three options:\r\n<ol>\r\n 	<li>Buy from you</li>\r\n 	<li>Buy from your competitor</li>\r\n 	<li>Do nothing</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nYou may think your competitors are your biggest problem, but in reality itâs more likely to be a fight against inertia. Therefore you need to answer the question of why they should buy first in addition to why they should buy from YOU.\r\n\r\nWe live in a sound bite, MTV generation which has to deal with thousands of messages each day. The importance of crafting your message in an immediately understandable and impactful way has never been more important.\r\n\r\nCan you explain your product and the unique benefit it offers in a single short sentence?\r\n\r\nIf you take nothing else away from this article take this:Â <strong>Confusion leads to no sales</strong>\r\n\r\nThis is especially so when explaining a complex product.\r\n\r\nLetâs take a look at an example from one of the worldâs best marketing companies â Apple.\r\n\r\nWhen they launched their now legendary music player, the iPod, they could have talked about the 5 gigabyte storage capacity or other technical features. But instead how did they promote it?\r\n\r\nâ1000 songs in your pocketâ\r\n\r\nGenius! 5 gigabytes doesnât mean a thing to most consumers. Neither does a bunch of technical jargon, but â1000 songs in your pocketâ â anyone can instantly understand that and the benefits it will offer.\r\n\r\nApple was by no means the first portable music player on the market or even the best, but they were by far the most successful because of their ability to quickly and easily convey the reasons why you should buy.\r\n\r\nYour clarity around this will have a huge impact on the success of your business.','The Two Questions On The Mind Of Your Prospect That Will Make Or Break The Sale','','publish','open','open','','the-two-questions-on-the-mind-of-your-prospect-that-will-make-or-break-the-sale','','','2017-08-14 22:21:57','2017-08-14 22:21:57','',0,'http://www.localhost/fco/?p=412',0,'post','',0),(413,1,'2017-08-05 02:12:05','2017-08-05 02:12:05','','post-headquestion','','inherit','open','closed','','post-headquestion','','','2017-08-05 02:12:05','2017-08-05 02:12:05','',412,'http://www.localhost/fco/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/post-headquestion.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(415,1,'2017-08-02 02:13:26','2017-08-02 02:13:26','One of the most disturbing trends I have seen over the past few years, is people allowing technology to dominate their lives, waste their time and allow themselves to effectively develop a learned attention deficit disorder.\r\n\r\nEmail has a special place in this discussion. People are treating email as a real-time communications tool, reacting to the email âtingâ or visual cue with an almost Pavlovian response.\r\n\r\nWhile email is a wonderful tool, it has become an absolute menace to productivity for at least two reasons: volume and incorrect usage.\r\n\r\nMany email programs check for new messages EVERY MINUTE. That means in a 9 to 5 workday you are giving people 480 opportunities to interrupt you, not including your other methods of contact such as instant messaging, telephone calls and chatty co-workers asking if you âhave a minuteâ.\r\n\r\nHere are two practical tips for getting this monster under control.\r\n<h2>1. Keep Your Email Program Closed By Default</h2>\r\nOpen your email program only a few designated times each day â preferably only once or twice per day if thatâs possible.\r\n\r\nThis will accomplish two things. Firstly and most importantly it will allow you to have more focused and uninterrupted concentration on your most important tasks.\r\n\r\nSecondly, it will reduce volume because people expecting immediate responses will stop sending you email and when they do it will be more thorough and to the point, as they know they will only hear back from you once or twice a day at most.\r\n\r\nDonât worry, if something is truly urgent, they will pick up the phone and call you (have you ever heard of someone emailing for an ambulance?).\r\n<h2>2. Adopt A Productivity System</h2>\r\nThe simple fact is that most people donât really know how to use their email.\r\n\r\nSome treat it as a to-do list system, while others treat it as an archive for all of their communications. The simple fact is that your email is just an electronic version of your physical mailbox or in-tray.\r\n\r\nWhat do you do when you collect mail from your mailbox?<strong>Â Remove it!</strong>Â You donât store it there or leave it in the mailbox as a reminder of what to do later. You bring it in and (hopefully) handle it.\r\n\r\nYour email handling process should be part of your overall productivity system. I would recommend the tenants held inÂ <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0142000280/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1299129313&amp;sr=8-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">David Allenâs excellent Getting Things Done (GTD)</a>Â system.\r\n\r\nHowever go with whatever system works for you. The important thing is to have a system which gives you clear rules on how to handle growing volumes of incoming information, whether this be in the form of email or anything else.','Making Technology Your Slave','','publish','open','open','','making-technology-your-slave','','','2017-08-14 22:07:47','2017-08-14 22:07:47','',0,'http://www.localhost/fco/?p=415',0,'post','',0),(416,1,'2017-08-05 02:13:19','2017-08-05 02:13:19','','post-laptopchain','','inherit','open','closed','','post-laptopchain','','','2017-08-05 02:13:19','2017-08-05 02:13:19','',415,'http://www.localhost/fco/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/post-laptopchain.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(418,1,'2017-08-05 02:15:34','0000-00-00 00:00:00',' ','','','draft','closed','closed','','','','','2017-08-05 02:15:34','0000-00-00 00:00:00','',0,'http://www.localhost/fco/?p=418',1,'nav_menu_item','',0),(419,1,'2017-08-05 02:15:34','0000-00-00 00:00:00',' ','','','draft','closed','closed','','','','','2017-08-05 02:15:34','0000-00-00 00:00:00','',0,'http://www.localhost/fco/?p=419',1,'nav_menu_item','',0),(420,1,'2017-08-05 02:15:34','0000-00-00 00:00:00',' ','','','draft','closed','closed','','','','','2017-08-05 02:15:34','0000-00-00 00:00:00','',0,'http://www.localhost/fco/?p=420',1,'nav_menu_item','',0),(421,1,'2017-08-05 02:15:34','0000-00-00 00:00:00',' ','','','draft','closed','closed','','','','','2017-08-05 02:15:34','0000-00-00 00:00:00','',0,'http://www.localhost/fco/?p=421',1,'nav_menu_item','',0),(425,1,'2017-08-05 02:17:15','2017-08-05 02:17:15',' ','','','publish','closed','closed','','425','','','2017-08-05 06:09:43','2017-08-05 06:09:43','',0,'http://www.localhost/fco/?p=425',1,'nav_menu_item','',0),(427,1,'2017-08-05 02:29:13','2017-08-05 02:29:13','','Contact Us','','publish','closed','closed','','contact-us','','','2017-08-05 06:09:43','2017-08-05 06:09:43','',0,'http://www.localhost/fco/?p=427',4,'nav_menu_item','',0),(428,1,'2017-08-05 02:29:13','2017-08-05 02:29:13','','About Us','','publish','closed','closed','','about-us','','','2017-08-05 06:09:43','2017-08-05 06:09:43','',0,'http://www.localhost/fco/?p=428',3,'nav_menu_item','',0),(429,1,'2017-08-05 02:29:13','2017-08-05 02:29:13','','Blog','','publish','closed','closed','','blog','','','2017-08-05 06:09:43','2017-08-05 06:09:43','',0,'http://www.localhost/fco/?p=429',2,'nav_menu_item','',0),(432,1,'2017-08-05 02:35:35','2017-08-05 02:35:35','<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Putting out fresh, relevant content is more than a good idea for companies â today, itâs a vital step in achieving business success. Through content, you can engage prospects and customers, boost search results for your website, enhance branding, and more. So how do you get started? It all begins with building a content calendar that is based on your overallÂ content strategy.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Hereâs a look at how to map your content to the sales cycle â for both current and prospective customers âÂ and use this information to create a strategic content calendar.Â <span id=\"more-35795\"></span></span>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Step 1: Look at your sales cycle</span></h2>\r\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">The first step in creating your content calendar is to understand the phases of your companyâs sales cycle. Say youâre a commercial cleaning company. Ask yourself how people become your customers. Do they find you through pay-per-click ads on search pages? Television advertising? Word-of-mouth referrals from other clients? Talk to your salespeople and find out what your typical lead-to-conversion cycle looks like. Say itâs typically online marketing from your sales team, followed by an in-person meeting with interested parties, and then personalized sales packets that propose custom cleaning plans. Youâd want to identify key demographics in the timeline, such as new leads (the people seeing your online ads), interested prospects (the people who contact you for more info), new customers, returning customers, former customers, etc. These will be the categories to which you allocate topics.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Take time to learn as much about these different areas as you can. If your new leads come primarily through online ads, spend time finding out about the prospects who respond to them. Once youâve gathered data on these groups of clients, youâre ready to start planning the content you will target them with.</span>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Step 2: Brainstorm topics and align them to categories</span></h2>\r\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">After youâve nailed down the stages of prospects in your sales cycle, your next step is brainstorming topics for them. If you are a commercial cleaning company, think about the concerns that facility managers may have that would prompt a visit from your salespeople. For example: Are they worried about whether or not youâll be able to manage the damage from heavy traffic in their hallways? Are they concerned about LEED certification issues? Bam! Youâve got ideas to fill your content calendar with topics that address their needs. So your list for this stage of the sales cycle might look like the following:</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li class=\"first-child\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Keeping Your Facility in Stunning Shape</span></li>\r\n 	<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">How to Make a Strong First Impression in Your Entryway</span></li>\r\n 	<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">What Happens When You Have a Last-Minute Cleaning Emergency</span></li>\r\n 	<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">How to Manage Weather Damage to Your Carpeting</span></li>\r\n 	<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The Ins and Outs of LEED Certification</span></li>\r\n 	<li class=\"last-child\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Sustainable Cleaning Practices</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Youâll devise lists like these for each stage of the sales cycle. Once you have exhausted all your ideas, you can move to step three.</span>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Step 3: Set your content calendar</span></h2>\r\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Pull out an actual calendar, either on paper or online, and start scheduling content into it. There are many different types of content, so donât think the list should be only blog topics, or only email newsletters, or only pay-per-click advertising. Consider all these different types, too:</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li class=\"first-child\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Photos</span></li>\r\n 	<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Videos</span></li>\r\n 	<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Case studies</span></li>\r\n 	<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Social media updates</span></li>\r\n 	<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Infographics</span></li>\r\n 	<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Charts</span></li>\r\n 	<li class=\"last-child\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">eBooks</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Again, talk with your salespeople to find out the best frequency, time of day, day of the week, etc., for delivering your content, and plan your content calendar accordingly. You can also ask them for their advice on building your topic ideas into useful content that will serve your audienceâs needs. So, for example, your topics that cater to interested prospects might need to be seasonal (i.e., relating to different weather damage in different seasons, etc.). Consider the following factors:</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li class=\"first-child\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">How seasonality affects your business</span></li>\r\n 	<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Industry trends, conferences, events</span></li>\r\n 	<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Timing of new product launches</span></li>\r\n 	<li class=\"last-child\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Company news and announcements</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">After youâve taken the three steps outlined above, start putting your content into place. Write the articles, make the videos, schedule the ad campaigns, and so on. Monitor the results of your efforts, and continually refine and adjust the type and schedule of content accordingly.

Maybe you wrote it weeks, months or even years ago. You published your blog content and shared your visual content but, for whatever reason, your blog posts didnât see the momentum that you were hoping for. Somewhere along the line your content strategy flopped, your target audience didnât connect, or you just got sidestepped on the social networks. In short your content marketing efforts arenât getting noticed.\r\n\r\n<em>So now what?</em>Â Do you just let all those blog posts sit there and stagnate in the archives while you pump out a load of fresh content creation? Or, do you turn it into something extraordinary? Repurposing content is all about taking your existing great content and blog posts, and presenting it to a whole new target audience on a different platform.\r\n\r\nImagine being able to turn blog content into actionable podcasts or PDF files into engaging slideshow presentations shows. Imagine being able to create content that is fresh and fabulous from what you already have.\r\n\r\n<em>What would that do for your bottom line?</em>\r\n\r\nItâs possible, through choosing to repurpose blog posts and content as part of your content marketing plan. Deciding to repurpose content is simply taking your existing content and tweaking it for different learning styles and therefore making it into a new blog post. It is not simply content spinning or rehashing old or outdated information in a way that is too close to creating duplicate content.\r\n\r\nInstead, itâs more like refreshing â finding a new purpose for existing information and tweaking you blog post so that it appeals to a larger audience segment and becomes fresh content again. Your target audience may then want to share it on their social media platforms, and your search engine results may also get a boost.\r\n\r\nSo, how do you get started with these content repurposing tips?\r\n\r\nLetâs take a closer look, first at the different ways that people learn and then at the best approach for getting them to retain and act onÂ <em>what</em>Â theyâve learned. This is important as you start to approach the different methods for repurposed content itself and to work these factors into your content marketing plan.\r\n<p class=\"alert\">Learn how I grew my traffic byÂ <a href=\"http://neilpatel.com/consulting/\">193% in one year</a>Â through content repurposing and freshening up old blog posts.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>How Do People Learn?</strong></h2>\r\nThink back to one of the earliest lessons you learned as a child: the stove is hot and it will burn you if you touch it.\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>If youâre primarily a visual learner, you might have seen the fire or the hot burner and trusted that your parent was right. Or, you saw a sibling touch the hot stove and noticed their reaction and that was enough to dissuade you from touching it!</li>\r\n 	<li>If youâre primarily an auditory (hearing) learner, you heard your parents tell you the stove was hot, you trusted they were right and you didnât touch the stove.</li>\r\n 	<li>If youâre primarily a kinesthetic (touch/experience) learner, you touched the stove, felt the burn and never did it again.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou might already know which type of learner you are, but you might be surprised to know that you use a combination of learning styles. Learning to drive requires more hands-on teaching than, say, learning a foreign language. No method is better or worse than another.\r\n\r\nSo, now that you know the various ways that people learn, how do you engage them with your content marketing strategy?\r\n\r\nAccording to aÂ <a href=\"http://www.columbia.edu/cu/tat/pdfs/active%20learning.pdf\">Columbia University study,</a>Â people learn best when active learning takes place. Active learning means being personally involved in the lesson (or great content being shared). Itâs not just simple memorization and regurgitation of facts and figures, but actual inquiry, discovery and interpretation. This is something to bear in mind when it comes to content creation and your content marketing plan.\r\n\r\nFor example, an instructor typically speaks 100-200 words per minute, but when quizzed on the retention of that information, students only hear and process about half as much. They retain about 70% of the information that they hear in the first 10 minutes of class and about 20% of what they hear in the last 10 minutes.\r\n\r\nCouple that with the search engine and social network browsing habits of the typical internet user and you can see what youâre up against: providing helpful, actionable information to people with short attention spans. Fortunately, Iâm going to walk you through exactly how to do this, while shortening your workload as a content marketer considerably.\r\n\r\nLetâs get started with these content repurposing tips.\r\n<h2><strong>What Exactly is Content Repurposing?</strong></h2>\r\nOpting to repurpose content is simply taking your existing content (blog content, visual content, etc) and reworking it to fit the needs of different styles of learning. It isnât, however, just reading your blog content as a podcast as this is close to duplicate content. It takes into account how visitors learn best and uses methods that are proven to get them to act on that information.\r\n\r\nFor example, auditory learners may sign up to listen to your webinar, but they also need to know that what theyâre hearing is trusted information. Â So, they may need more of a foundation through things like testimonials (here again, audio will work better than plain text!), interviews with other experts and so on.\r\n<h2><strong>Content Repurposing versus Republishing</strong></h2>\r\nContent repurposing is admittedly more involved than just republishing your existing content in a different format. You can republish your blog post into a slideshow presentation, but if your blog post doesnât take into account the tidbit-style of a slideshow presentation, youâll end up with 50 slides just rehashing what could have easily been read in a single page.\r\n\r\nWhen you repurpose content, youâre putting your most popular, evergreen and truly great content into the hands of a target audience who might not otherwise get to see or enjoy that created content, in a way that they can easily understand and appreciate.\r\n\r\nThe best part is, you can start your repurpose content plan the minute you hit PUBLISH on those blog posts. This is one of the best content repurposing tips you are sure to get.\r\n<h2><strong>Why Repurpose Content?</strong></h2>\r\nSimply put, when you take your content creations and repurpose them it adds more horsepower to your marketing strategy. It takes your content strategy further much faster than you could ever do on your own. It helps you to build up a fan base that you may have never known existed outside of your target audience. And, it does this without a lot of effort on your part.\r\n\r\n<em>Why reinvent the wheel when you can simply add more wheels to the machine?</em>\r\n<h2><strong>How to Repurpose Content</strong></h2>\r\nSo, now that we know the what and the why, itâs time to get down to business and actually look at our repurpose content plan.\r\n\r\nFirst, take a look at your most popular, evergreen and truly great content. You can see which old and new posts from your content creation archives are performing best in Google Analytics. The images below, fromÂ <a href=\"http://vimm.com/finding-most-viewed-blog-post/\">Vimm.com</a>, will walk you through each step.\r\n\r\nSimply log into your Google account and choose the time frame that you want to analyze your content creations from your calendar.\r\n\r\nThen, click on the Behavior tab and go to âSite Contentâ and âAll Pagesâ:\r\n\r\n<img class=\"lazy aligncenter size-full wp-image-1010\" src=\"http://72gpf1za5iq428ekh3r7qjc1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/image132.png\" alt=\"image13\" width=\"263\" height=\"755\" data-original=\"http://72gpf1za5iq428ekh3r7qjc1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/image132.png\" />\r\n\r\nYouâll then see something like this, with your posts sorted by the highest number of page views:\r\n\r\n<img class=\"lazy aligncenter size-full wp-image-1004\" src=\"http://72gpf1za5iq428ekh3r7qjc1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/image074.png\" alt=\"image07\" width=\"477\" height=\"605\" data-original=\"http://72gpf1za5iq428ekh3r7qjc1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/image074.png\" />\r\n\r\nOnce you know which blog content is performing best, itâs time to make aÂ <a href=\"https://www.mindmup.com/#m:new\">mind map</a>Â of potential ideas for new, repurposed created content. Start with your best performing blog post and create spokes for new ideas out from it. Hereâs an example to walk you through each step:\r\n\r\nBufferApp determined that one of their most perpetuallyÂ <a href=\"https://blog.bufferapp.com/10-scientifically-proven-ways-to-make-yourself-happier\">high-performing post</a>Â was from August, 2013. It was entitled, â10 Simple Things You Can Do Today that Will Make You Happier, Backed by Science.â Â Those things included studies and graphics on everything from sleep to exercise.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://neilpatel.com/\"><img src=\"http://72gpf1za5iq428ekh3r7qjc1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/alana-mitchell.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"297\" /></a>\r\n\r\nSo, what are some ways that we might create content like this in a new way? If you take a look at the individual items, thereâs a wealth of ideas and content repurposing tips that spring up. For instance:\r\n\r\n<em>Original Content Point: Meditate: Rewire Your Brain for Happiness</em>\r\n\r\n<em>New Post and Content Points:</em>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><em>Inner peace mindful meditation audio</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><em>Walk-through video of proper meditation breathing techniques</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><em>Infographic or even slideshow presentation on the scientific benefits of meditation</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"lazy aligncenter size-full wp-image-998\" src=\"http://72gpf1za5iq428ekh3r7qjc1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/image01.jpg\" alt=\"image01\" width=\"570\" height=\"688\" data-original=\"http://72gpf1za5iq428ekh3r7qjc1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/image01.jpg\" />\r\n\r\n<em>An example of a meditation infographic</em>\r\n\r\n<em>Original Content Point: Help Others: 100 Hours a Year is the Magic Number</em>\r\n\r\n<em>New Content Points:</em>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>X Volunteering Opportunities Happening Now in (Your Local Town)</li>\r\n 	<li>How to Start an Employee Volunteering Movement at Your Workplace</li>\r\n 	<li>How the Brain Responds to Volunteering</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"lazy aligncenter size-full wp-image-1007\" src=\"http://72gpf1za5iq428ekh3r7qjc1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/image101.jpg\" alt=\"image10\" width=\"617\" height=\"627\" data-original=\"http://72gpf1za5iq428ekh3r7qjc1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/image101.jpg\" />\r\n\r\n<em>An example of a volunteering infographic</em>\r\n\r\nNow that you know what to look for, letâs get down to the actual repurposing.\r\n<h2><strong>Repurposing Content into a Blog Post</strong></h2>\r\nWhat makes good blog content? As it turns out, thereâs a good deal of scientific data behind the writing of a blog post, such as this gem fromÂ <a href=\"https://blog.bufferapp.com/perfect-blog-post-research-data\">BufferApp</a>:\r\n\r\n<img class=\"lazy aligncenter size-full wp-image-1005\" src=\"http://72gpf1za5iq428ekh3r7qjc1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/image083.png\" alt=\"image08\" width=\"800\" height=\"1200\" data-original=\"http://72gpf1za5iq428ekh3r7qjc1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/image083.png\" />\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, you need to condense your headline into six words â and make them work. Hereâs a simple formula that can help:\r\n\r\n<img class=\"lazy aligncenter size-full wp-image-1008\" src=\"http://72gpf1za5iq428ekh3r7qjc1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/image113.png\" alt=\"image11\" width=\"1350\" height=\"764\" data-original=\"http://72gpf1za5iq428ekh3r7qjc1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/image113.png\" />\r\n\r\nThink itâs too hard to squeeze all that clickable goodness into just six words? Here are a few examples:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>8 Delicious Appetizers made in 8 Minutes</li>\r\n 	<li>10 Proven Winter Blues Remedies</li>\r\n 	<li>3 Unbelievable Stories of Unstoppable Kids</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"alignright align-sc\"><a href=\"http://neilpatel.com/\"><img src=\"http://72gpf1za5iq428ekh3r7qjc1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/neilad3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"350\" height=\"350\" /></a></p>\r\nOf course, you can use a featured image and a sub-headline to expand upon the headline in more detail. Springboard off of those sub-headlines into a story and youâve got the beginnings to create content that works based on an old piece of content.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, thereâs a lot more to the perfect blog post than adding visual content and timing. For example, whatÂ <em>kinds</em>Â of blog posts do best both on and off social media? Should you allow comments? What about social network sharing buttons? Youâll obviously want to split test these points to draw your own conclusions, but the chart below should give you a strong foundation to build your blog posts from.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"lazy aligncenter size-full wp-image-1011\" src=\"http://72gpf1za5iq428ekh3r7qjc1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/image141.jpg\" alt=\"image14\" width=\"727\" height=\"1999\" data-original=\"http://72gpf1za5iq428ekh3r7qjc1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/image141.jpg\" />\r\n\r\nSo, taking your existing content creations and reworking it into a blog post (or several blog posts in a series) works best when the created content in question can be formatted into a type of list, slideshow presentation or tutorial. It ideally shares a story in the beginning (the âhookâ) and incorporates a handful of relevant photos, as well as deeper links into your site for more information.\r\n\r\nThe âsoundbites for sharingâ is an interesting point that refers to snippets from the article that can be shared on social networks.\r\n\r\nIf youâre using WordPress, thereâs aÂ <a href=\"http://todaymade.com/blog/click-to-tweet-wordpress-plugin/\">Click-to-Tweet pluginÂ </a>that makes this process simple and straightforward. By using regular WordPress pull quotes and customizing the message that you want to have appear, the Click-to-Tweet plugin manages the rest â making nicely formatted, Twitter-ready boxes that your readers can simply click to share.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"lazy aligncenter size-full wp-image-1000\" src=\"http://72gpf1za5iq428ekh3r7qjc1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/image032.png\" alt=\"image03\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" data-original=\"http://72gpf1za5iq428ekh3r7qjc1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/image032.png\" />\r\n\r\n<em>An example of the click-to-tweet plugin</em>\r\n\r\nNow turning your content creations into a blog post or a series of blog posts is one thing. But, oftentimes youâre starting with a blog post and looking for content repurposing tips for other platforms, so letâs take a look at some alternatives.\r\n<h2><strong>Repurposing Content into eBooks</strong></h2>\r\nIn the U.S.,Â <a href=\"http://www.statista.com/statistics/190800/ebook-sales-revenue-forecast-for-the-us-market/\">eBook sales revenue has risen steadily</a>Â year after year â from about $274 million dollars in 2008 to a projected 8.5+ BILLION by 2017. Much of their popularity steps from the widespread use of tablets and mobile phones, making e-books a compact way to enjoy books on nearly any subject.\r\n\r\nThe best way to repurpose your created content into an eBook â whether you want to sell it or give it away, is to capitalize on the value that your customers or prospects will get from it. This is always a good plan for content marketing.\r\n\r\nNotice I didnât say the valueÂ <em>you</em>Â assign to it. If youâre going to repurpose your existing content into an ebook, it needs to be the best possible quality and contain the best possible information to create value in the customersâ minds. This doesnât mean just creating duplicate content in a new format, but adapting your content creations to fit.\r\n\r\nThat means taking the time to brainstorm, layout and format your ebook as if it were an actual book being prepared for print. Use a tool likeÂ <a href=\"http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php\">Scrivener</a>Â to layout the various chapters and what information theyâll contain. Copyblogger has aÂ <a href=\"http://www.copyblogger.com/ebook-in-30-day/\">30-day roadmap to writing an e-book</a>Â from scratch.\r\n<p class=\"alignleft align-sc\"><a href=\"http://neilpatel.com/\"><img src=\"http://72gpf1za5iq428ekh3r7qjc1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/neilad2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"350\" height=\"350\" /></a></p>\r\nSince youâre using your existing created content, your timeframe will likely be even shorter. With modern word processing software, you can save your finished product as a PDF that makes it available for a wide variety of computer and device platforms.\r\n\r\nThe most important thing to keep in mind is that the ebook shouldnât just be a copy and paste-job of duplicate content. Remember, weâre all about repurposed content here. Â So, expand upon, refresh, reorganize and build on what youâve already covered.\r\n\r\nTackle it from a new angle or rework it for a new segment of your existing audience. Turn it into an easily consumable guide, such as a checklist or fill-in-the-blank template.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"lazy aligncenter size-full wp-image-1006\" src=\"http://72gpf1za5iq428ekh3r7qjc1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/image094.png\" alt=\"image09\" width=\"1030\" height=\"661\" data-original=\"http://72gpf1za5iq428ekh3r7qjc1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/image094.png\" />\r\n\r\n<em>The Common Sense SEO Checklist dates from 2009 but is still one of the most popular posts on CSS Tricks.</em>\r\n\r\nWriting an ebook doesnât have to be a mammoth undertaking. Consider the things that your customers would find most valuable at each stage of their decision-making process and create content that makes that process easier, smoother or faster. It really is that simple.\r\n\r\nNow, an ebook is a great downloadable platform for your existing content creations. But, for many people, there simply arenât enough hours in the day to read everything that they want to read, no matter how interesting it might be.\r\n\r\nThatâs where slide shows come in. Fast, clear and concise, slide shows are gaining in popularity as a way to get crucial, detailed information on a topic, without all the fluff and filler. They can incorporate audio narration, or simply be visual content aids to illustrate more complex ideas.\r\n\r\nSo, how do you turn your existing content into a slideshow presentation? Letâs take a look.\r\n<h2><strong>Repurposing Content to Presentations/Slide shows</strong></h2>\r\nWhen choosing to repurpose content into a slideshow presentation, the worst thing that you can do is to simply read from the existing content or copy/paste it into the slides verbatim like duplicate content. Youâll want to start out by creating a main idea outline out of what you want to say, then fill in details as relevant.\r\n\r\nDonât cram a lot of words into each slide in your slideshow presentation. Around 15 words or so is ideal. Remember, you want to get the main points across. Getting the visual content and (optionally) the sound right are going to be the most time-consuming parts.\r\n\r\nWith images, BBCâs audio slideshow presentation expert, Paul Kerley, recommends approximately 8-10 images per minute. That may sound like a LOT of images, but when you see an example of what justÂ <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ41md4caxk\">five photos in one minute looks like</a>, itâs obvious that the pace is painfully slow. This example usesÂ <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI_tn-aV8XM\">9 pictures in one minute</a>.\r\n\r\nAccording toÂ <a href=\"http://www.getluckie.net/\">Mark Luckie</a>, a journalist and interactive designer, each photo should appear on the screen for no less than 3 seconds, but no more than 10. Itâs a delicate balance which depends entirely upon the images in the slideshow presentation, the pace of the story and the importance of the two points together.\r\n\r\nEven then, an area where I see many people agonizing, when it comes to slide shows, is the choice of a template. Youâd approach this just as you would the design of a website:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Make generous use of whitespace</li>\r\n 	<li>Incorporate relevant typography and fonts</li>\r\n 	<li>Make sure that the layout is designed to improve comprehension of the slides, not detract from it.</li>\r\n 	<li>You can incorporate 3-4 colors in your design, but have one accent color for the points you really want to stand out.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"lazy aligncenter size-full wp-image-999\" src=\"http://72gpf1za5iq428ekh3r7qjc1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/image021.jpg\" alt=\"image02\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" data-original=\"http://72gpf1za5iq428ekh3r7qjc1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/image021.jpg\" data-pin-nopin=\"true\" />\r\n\r\n<em>Thereâs just way too much going on in this slide to give it much attention</em>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"lazy aligncenter size-full wp-image-1009\" src=\"http://72gpf1za5iq428ekh3r7qjc1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/image12.jpg\" alt=\"image12\" width=\"656\" height=\"486\" data-original=\"http://72gpf1za5iq428ekh3r7qjc1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/image12.jpg\" />\r\n\r\n<em>This slide example uses white-space and eye-path gimmicks (arrows) to draw your attention to each statement</em>\r\n\r\nOnce you have your slide show finished, itâs time to get the word out.Â <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.com/\">Slideshare</a>Â is the most popular choice, butÂ <a href=\"http://www.authorstream.com/\">AuthorstreamÂ </a>andÂ <a href=\"http://www.slideboom.com/\">Slideboom</a>Â are also worth checking out.\r\n<h2><strong>Repurposing Content to Social Media</strong></h2>\r\nMost people think of content repurposing tips to fit social media as just slapping up a photo and a link to their blog. Â But, the truth is that all of your posts will do remarkably better across all platforms, if you keep in mind what works best for each social network â and when.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-social-media-popularity\">Frac.tl and BuzzStream</a>Â analyzed over 200,000 different pieces of content Â from 11 different market verticals to try to understand what content get shared most on social media. As it turns out, different types of posts across different social media industries do better in different months.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"lazy aligncenter size-full wp-image-1003\" src=\"http://72gpf1za5iq428ekh3r7qjc1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/image062.jpg\" alt=\"image06\" width=\"646\" height=\"428\" data-original=\"http://72gpf1za5iq428ekh3r7qjc1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/image062.jpg\" data-pin-nopin=\"true\" />\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of the study, âwhat-postsâ were blog posts that provided deeper information on a topic (comparisons, etc), while âwhy-postsâ asked a question and provided follow-up by means of studies and insights and ended with a focused conclusion.\r\n\r\nList posts were in the lead overall, with over 20,000 shares per month, or 22.45% social traction, narrowly followed by why-posts at 22.35%.\r\n<p class=\"alignright align-sc\"><a href=\"http://neilpatel.com/\"><img src=\"http://72gpf1za5iq428ekh3r7qjc1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/neilad1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"350\" height=\"350\" /></a></p>\r\nBut again, the number of shares depends on the industry as well as the month. As you can see from the chart above, what-posts did extremely well in October, but lists topped the charts in June.\r\n\r\nSo, reworking content or your blog post into a list, a âwhat,â âwhyâ or âhowâ post or even a video can greatly increase the number of social shares and comments that you get versus the more traditional photo-and-link.\r\n\r\nAside from slide shows and social media, turning your content into a white paper or case study can help catapult you into becoming a recognized authority in your field. If youâre willing to do a little extra research and legwork, it may also earn you some valuable backlinks from well-known websites.\r\n\r\nLetâs take a closer look:\r\n<h2><strong>Repurposing Content to White papers/Case Studies</strong></h2>\r\nAccording to Eccolo Mediaâs 2014 B2BÂ <a href=\"http://eccolomedia.digarati.com/article/index/4/33\">Technology Content Survey Report</a>, white papers rank as the most popular choice for enterprise buying decisions and the third highest type of content influencer for small and large businesses alike.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"lazy aligncenter size-full wp-image-1002\" src=\"http://72gpf1za5iq428ekh3r7qjc1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/image054.png\" alt=\"image05\" width=\"673\" height=\"462\" data-original=\"http://72gpf1za5iq428ekh3r7qjc1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/image054.png\" />\r\n\r\nBut, what exactlyÂ <em>isÂ </em>a white paper? Essentially, a white paper is a marketing tool that promotes your company in a favorable way by providing facts, statistics and other concrete details that then reflect back onto what youâre offering.\r\n\r\nThey often describe technical benefits or promote a certain strategy or methodology that bolsters your product or service. Because they refer to facts and figures, theyâre viewed as more authoritative and informative in helping along a userâs buying decision than other types of promotional material (brochures and such).\r\n\r\nFortunately, a white paper is very easy to write. Typically, they fall into two types:\r\n<ol>\r\n 	<li>List-style white papers (12 Benefits to Choosing a Multifunction Printer, 7 Things to Look for in an Email Marketing Service) and</li>\r\n 	<li>Traditional-style white papers that provide more detailed insights that a user might not ordinarily know about.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWriting the first type is very simple. Hereâs how to do it:\r\n\r\nFirst, start with a prompt, like âThings to Avoid When Buying A â¦â or â(Your Topic) Best Practices. Then, add a number of items that you can reasonably come up with. One example might be â12 Ways to Prevent Your WordPress Website from Being Hacked.â\r\n\r\nIf you want your white paper to apply to a specific group of people, you can add them as a subtitle. Â So, following on our example above, we might gear this specific white paper to people who arenât very tech-savvy. Â We could add âEven if Youâre a Complete Blogging Beginner.â\r\n\r\nThen, simply go about writing each point â editing along the way if you come up with more or less.\r\n\r\nThe issue here is that if you donât research your facts and figures or you simply rehash whatâs already known about the subject, your users arenât going to find you to be an authority on the subject at all. If anything, theyâll feel like you completely wasted their time.\r\n\r\nThatâs why a more traditional white paper may be the way to go, particularly if youâre targeting enterprise users who expect more facts and figures.\r\n\r\nTo do this, first write down the main benefit your product or service offers. This gives you a foundation of context that you can use to find supporting evidence that backs up your benefit and makes it stand out as the only real solution in the readerâs mind.\r\n\r\nRemember that youâre writing about the main benefit to the reader â the more urgent it is that they act, the better. Above all else, donât mention your product or service. It may sound counter-intuitive, but you want the audience to make that connection in their own minds, rather than you telling them.\r\n\r\nPolish off your white paper with a call-to-action that gets them involved and active with what you have to offer, be it a demo, a free sample or a webinar. Whatever it is, your white paper should act as the next logical step in the buyerâs decision-making process.\r\n\r\nCase studies, which fall into the same broad category as white papers, are handled a bit differently. The Content Marketing Institute reported, in theirÂ <a href=\"http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/2014/02/small-business-2014-content-marketing-research/\">2014 B2B Small Business Content Marketing Report</a>, that case studies were the most effective means of marketing to businesses.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"lazy aligncenter size-full wp-image-1001\" src=\"http://72gpf1za5iq428ekh3r7qjc1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/image04.jpg\" alt=\"image04\" width=\"667\" height=\"650\" data-original=\"http://72gpf1za5iq428ekh3r7qjc1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/image04.jpg\" data-pin-nopin=\"true\" />\r\n\r\nThe fact is, people want to see where your product has excelled. They want clear, definitive proof that you can do the same for them. So, how can you deliver with your content marketing? Letâs take a closer look.\r\n\r\nFirst, case studies donât need to be flashy. According to the Eccolo report referenced above, people overwhelmingly prefer plain text case studies to other varieties like slides or videos. Your case study can be 500 words or 1500 words â as long as it gets to the point in a way thatâs free of fluff and filler.\r\n\r\nUse your case study to tell a story. Your company is the hero, the problem the customer faced is the villain and the customer themselves could be viewed as the damsel-in-distress. Maybe traditional methods didnât work to help rescue that damsel. Maybe you had to go about it a different way. Tell the story and share the triumphant results that you got for your client.\r\n\r\nShare the tools that you used. When was there a turning point and what happened to lead up to it? Itâs possible your damsel-in-distress isnât just sitting on their hands, either. If they tried other solutions before yours, itâs important to mention that.\r\n\r\nFrom that point, tell how the customer was able to implement your product or service and the results that they got. Ideally share the before and after of things like productivity, split testing or other key indicators important to your audience.\r\n\r\nMost of the points that Iâve covered so far appeal primarily to visual or hands-on learners. But, the next and final content repurposing idea is absolute bliss for the auditory learner. Interviews and podcasts are excellent ways to connect with your audience, even when they canât be at their computer.\r\n<h2><strong>Repurposing Content as a Podcast</strong></h2>\r\nReworking your content to fit a podcast format doesnât have to be overwhelming. After all, youâre not creating your own radio show (at least, not at first!). There are some technical considerations to keep in mind, however:\r\n\r\nFirst, choose a good microphone. A USB microphone that plugs directly into your computer is an ideal choice (<a href=\"http://www.bluemic.com/\">Blue</a>Â makes some good ones). A pop filter (to help cut down on breathing sounds, particularly with Bâs and Pâs) is also a good investment and can be had for as little as $5.\r\n\r\nYouâll also want proper recording software.Â <a href=\"http://audacity.sourceforge.net/\">Audacity</a>Â is good and itâs free. It lets you record a variety of different audio files and formats and has some good tools for noise reduction and other common issues that scream âamateur.â\r\n\r\n<img class=\"lazy aligncenter size-full wp-image-997\" src=\"http://72gpf1za5iq428ekh3r7qjc1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/image001.jpg\" alt=\"image00\" width=\"625\" height=\"569\" data-original=\"http://72gpf1za5iq428ekh3r7qjc1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/image001.jpg\" />\r\n\r\n<em>Audacity is a very popular sound editing program</em>\r\n\r\nIf you want to add a more professional touch, you can invest in a variety of other hardware (like a mixer) and software tools (like Pro Tools or Adobe Audition). Â But, for the purposes of this guide, weâre all about getting up and running quickly.\r\n\r\nOnce you have the tools, how do you go about repurposing your content to fit a podcast format?\r\n\r\nWell, there is no concrete formula to follow on what makes a good podcast. Remember that you will need consent from the artist if you want to play their song or video on your podcast. Free music can be had from sites likeÂ <a href=\"http://www.freesound.org/\">FreeSound.org</a>, which provides licensed sound effects and field recordings.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, consider points like the length of the podcast and the script. If youâll be interviewing someone else, go over the types of questions that youâll ask them, in advance â so there are no surprises.\r\n\r\nIf youâre feeling nervous, why not invite a colleague to speak about your particular niche or industry? Someone you know who would be delighted at the extra exposure while giving you a chance to hone your podcasting chops.\r\n\r\nAbove all, rework your content and blog posts in a way that will make people want to listen to you to learn more. Be funny. Be clever. Be interesting. There are plenty of cooking podcasts, but how many podcasts show you how to create amazing 4-course dinners using only 7 ingredients?\r\n\r\nIf you think you have the foundation for a regular podcasting show, take the time to record a series â but donât publish it yet. Can you keep the momentum going after the first week or the second? How about the sixth or seventh week? Some of the most interesting shows run out of steam after the fourth or fifth week, because the podcast owner failed to plan ahead.\r\n\r\nTake the time to formulate a podcast plan with just as much attention as you would a really good blog post. Planning ahead also gives you a bit of a buffer for times when your creative muse is âout to lunch.â\r\n<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>\r\nNow that you have several ideas and content repurposing tips to turn to when it comes to your blog posts, itâs time to make a workable plan of action. Take the time to decide which content or which blog post works well on different platforms and for which type of learner. Then, take to the airwaves, the blogosphere or the digital canvas, make your points and spread the word with your content marketing plan of action.\r\n\r\nNot every piece of content will be worth repurposing in every possible way. Â But, for those that do, you may very well reach a whole new audience that canât wait to see what youâll come up with next.\r\n\r\n<em>So, what content are you going to repurpose?

The move allows companies to classify more workers as freelancers, meaning they are not subject to the same federal wage and hour regulations as salaried employees.\r\n\r\nThe freelance economy is booming. According to 2016 data from theÂ <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2016/10/13/gig-economy-is-growing-heres-how-much.html\">Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution</a>, the number of workers operating as independent contractors has increased by 27 percent more than payroll employees.\r\n<div id=\"inline_movable_ad\"></div>\r\nBut businesses on Main Street have been reluctant to embrace this growing, often inexpensive and flexible labor pool.

Â Even some of our developers are working full time and contribute when they can, but that is a busy life style with a family. Â No, but most of our developers have been working for us since they first became what the corporate world would call junior developers. Â Because of this experience they know so much more than software development. Â Going to the 9-5 and just coding would get boring. Â We sacrifice full time benefits though. Â Our loss your gain. Â This is happening for the same reason Crowd Companies are a thing. WHile there is now soooooo much out there, the easy access to it all might make it easier for mavericks to come together to create whatever it is that my business model would be called. I can\'t find it anywhere. I will coin it A Freelance Collective for now, since Crowd Company and Freelancer collaborations(~group work), and Freelancer Companies (upwork) are something else. A Freelance Collective is defined as a company with more than five recognized workers at their disposal, usually with broad skill sets they are definitely less specialized as all of them can find gigs, that do not have to be paid by the company they are recognized in but paid as a freelancer for the client company. So pretty much they are freelancers but they regularly collaborate at least one hour on any one job. They are paid based on the gig i s the most defining characteristic.</h3>\r\n<h3>one defining characteristic is that the contributor/employees get paid job-to-job. Â Which I am not saying is a perk. Â Our loss, your gain. Â But there are tradeoff\'s like more flexability and little risk for training junior developers.</h3>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMosiac of different talents\r\n<h3>Also you didnt see em bc of the markets. Demand for small jobs from small businesses born out of the satisfying the tiniest , but still possibly deepest of niches is growing, and thus modular labor is growing. This is because of work environements being more fluid. THis is becasue of all the niches getting grooved out becasue of the internet content cornucopia. As the world transitions to the online world we will only see more of this. The other day I say an 80 year old learning wordpress. This will be common place. This is the easily observable and trend and it makes sense. Knowing how to use a computer wasn\'t a thing 15 years ago. It still is not a necessary thing.

Copy index.php to tpl_blog.php</h2>\r\nTo start, copy your index.php file from your current theme and rename the copied file tpl_blog.php. The reason for this is to get an exact copy of the theme functions and HTML structure from your current theme and to create a page template that will eventually be selectable from the âPage Templateâ dropdown.\r\n<h2>Step 2. Create Page Template ID</h2>\r\nIn your new file tpl_blog.php, you need to add a special comment to the top of the file that WordPress will recognize as a custom template.\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint prettyprinted\"><code lang=\"php\">\r\n<span class=\"com\">/*\r\nTemplate Name: Blog Posts\r\n*/</span></code></pre>\r\nSimply add that to the very top of your page and now WordPress will recognize it in the Edit Page screen sidebar.\r\n<h2>3. Use Custom Query for Posts</h2>\r\nPlace this below the get_header() template tag:\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint prettyprinted\"><code lang=\"php\"><span class=\"pun\">&lt;?</span><span class=\"pln\">php query_posts</span><span class=\"pun\">(</span><span class=\"str\">\'post_type=post&amp;post_status=publish&amp;posts_per_page=10&amp;paged=\'</span><span class=\"pun\">.</span><span class=\"pln\"> get_query_var</span><span class=\"pun\">(</span><span class=\"str\">\'paged\'</span><span class=\"pun\">));</span> <span class=\"pun\">?&gt;</span></code></pre>\r\nThis will override the current page query with a custom query for 10 paginated blog posts. Since weâre usingÂ <code>query_posts()</code>, we donât need to generate a new customÂ <code>WP_Query</code>Â to store the custom query.\r\n<h2>4. Add Navigational Links for Pagination</h2>\r\nBelow your post loop, add some links for pagination like so:\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint prettyprinted\"><code lang=\"php\"><span class=\"tag\">&lt;div</span> <span class=\"atn\">class</span><span class=\"pun\">=</span><span class=\"atv\">\"navigation\"</span><span class=\"tag\">&gt;</span>\r\n	<span class=\"tag\">&lt;span</span> <span class=\"atn\">class</span><span class=\"pun\">=</span><span class=\"atv\">\"newer\"</span><span class=\"tag\">&gt;</span><span class=\"pun\">&lt;?</span><span class=\"pln\">php previous_posts_link</span><span class=\"pun\">(</span><span class=\"pln\">__</span><span class=\"pun\">(</span><span class=\"str\">\'Â« Newer\'</span><span class=\"pun\">,</span><span class=\"str\">\'example\'</span><span class=\"pun\">))</span> <span class=\"pun\">?&gt;</span><span class=\"tag\">&lt;/span&gt;</span> <span class=\"tag\">&lt;span</span> <span class=\"atn\">class</span><span class=\"pun\">=</span><span class=\"atv\">\"older\"</span><span class=\"tag\">&gt;</span><span class=\"pun\">&lt;?</span><span class=\"pln\">php next_posts_link</span><span class=\"pun\">(</span><span class=\"pln\">__</span><span class=\"pun\">(</span><span class=\"str\">\'Older Â»\'</span><span class=\"pun\">,</span><span class=\"str\">\'example\'</span><span class=\"pun\">))</span> <span class=\"pun\">?&gt;</span><span class=\"tag\">&lt;/span&gt;</span>\r\n<span class=\"tag\">&lt;/div&gt;</span><span class=\"com\">&lt;!-- /.navigation --&gt;</span></code></pre>\r\nThis should be between theÂ <code>endwhile;</code>Â andÂ <code>endif;</code>Â sections of code in your theme.\r\n<h2>5. Reset the Query</h2>\r\nOnce youâve output all your posts and navigation, you can useÂ <code>wp_reset_query()</code>Â to reset theÂ <code>query_posts()</code>Â results that you created earlier. In lamens terms, youâve now reset the query to what it was before you calledÂ <code>query_posts()</code>.\r\n<h2>6. Putting it all together</h2>\r\nHereâs a completed page template that utilizes everything described above with additional markup and includes the loop:\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint prettyprinted\"><code lang=\"php\"><span class=\"tag\">&lt;php</span> <span class=\"atn\">get_header</span><span class=\"pln\">(); ?</span><span class=\"tag\">&gt;</span>\r\n\r\n	<span

Â documented but I think i have figured it out.... Only stack exchange offered manual answers, and there was a wp plugin. All other solutions are expensive as hell.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nobviously in 2010 it was still an issue\r\n\r\nfound this round about way on the way bottom of the discussion\r\n\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/846659/how-can-i-put-a-database-under-git-version-control/28123546#28123546\r\n\r\ncool video though\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c45AevIuYGk\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nin 2012 there was an answer, and one Im considering\r\n<h3 class=\"r\"><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13608706/using-version-control-git-on-a-mysql-database\">Using version control (Git) on a MySQL database - Stack Overflow</a></h3>\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/13608706/using-version-control-git-on-a-mysql-database\r\n\r\nQ:\r\n\r\nI am a WordPress Designer/Developer, who is getting more and more heavily involved with using version control, notably Git, though I do use SVN for some projects. I am currently using Beanstalk for my remote repo.\r\n\r\nAdding all of the WordPress files to my repo is no problem, if I wanted to I know I could .gitignore the wp-config file, but since I\'m the only developer, currently, and these projects are closed source, it really makes little sense.\r\n\r\nWordPress relies heavily on the database, as any CMS does, to keep textual content, and many settings depending on the specific plugin/theme configuration I\'m using. I\'m wondering what the best way of using version control on the database would be, if it\'s even possible. I guess I could do a SQL dump, though my MySQL server is running on Windows (read as: I don\'t know how to do it), and then add the SQL dump to my repository. But when I push something live, that poses huge security threats.\r\n\r\nIs there an accepted practice of doing this?\r\n\r\nA:\r\n\r\nYou can backup your database within a git repository. Of course, if you place the data into git in a binary form, you will lose all of git\'s ability to efficiently store the data using diffs (changes). So the number one best practice is this: store the data in a text serialised format.\r\n\r\nmysqldump is a suitable program to help you do this. It isn\'t perfect though. If anything disturbs the serialisation order of items (eg. as a result of creating new tables, etc.) then artificial breaks will enter into the diff. That will decrease the efficiency of storage. You could write a custom serialiser to serialise changes only -- but then you are doing the hard work that git is already good at. Just use the sql dump.\r\n\r\nThat being said, what you are wanting to do isn\'t what devs normally mean when they talk about putting the database in git. For instance, if you read the link posted by @eggyal (<a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/02/get-your-database-under-version-control.html\">link to codinghorror</a>) you will see that what is actually placed in git are the scripts needed to generate the initial database. There may be additional scripts, like those to populate the database data with a clean state, or to populate it with testing data. All such sql scripts are text files, and pretty much the same format as the sql dump you would get from mysqldump. So there\'s no reason you can\'t do it that way with your day-to-day data as well.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nthen theres this wp plugin, which i will also try\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/wp-sync-db/wp-sync-db\r\n\r\nI tried the wp sync. install and making it work took about an hour with everythign said and done. thats the first time i used a github wp plugin though. It wont work for our purposes as I realized that versioning the database will be crucial to working simultaneously in wordpress with someone other than myself. Â It wont be crucial if they are just changing the javascript things though. Since this is easy, compressable, and now its installed I might choose this. option.\r\n\r\nI have also been tryign different file types to see if github is able to parse and make them versionable.... may have found the one. I saved the DB as CodeGen and a .cs file came out that looks incredibly promising. Turns out github was not able to detect the content changes. I tried php and .sql file types and it looks okay. Â The diffs are the most detailed out of all the text files. Upon further testing i found that after i changed the file and replaced it and then did it agian. the .sql file updated correctly while the .phop file did not. Also it looks as though the .sql file was much more detailed in its diffs. The one redeemign quality about using .php was that the files are much more human readable. However, in the end .sql wins this battle as a definite contender in braindead ways to verision your DB and the great thing is it is still contained within GitHub no other platforms are needed so we are using githubs powerful diffs... next up are the final comabtants. Thoguh they deliver on their promises they require an expert to wield them.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFrom the dead Klonio, to these two compeeting (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37385823/liquibase-vs-flyway-which-one-to-use) db migration tools: flyway(https://flywaydb.org/getstarted/download) and Liquibase(http://download.liquibase.org/) comes a start to what could become the github od db/\'s\r\n\r\nBoth use the command line and look like they require a certain degree of SQL knowledge, or other more involved knowledge sets to operate with any sort of confidence.','CMS WordPress DB Versioning and Syncing With GitHub: A \'how to\' on Continuous Deployment','','pending','open','closed','','cms-wordpress-db-versioning-and-syncing-with-github-a-how-to-on-continuous-deployment','','','2017-08-09 19:21:38','2017-08-09 19:21:38','',0,'http://www.localhost/fco/?p=498',0,'post','',0),(499,1,'2017-08-05 15:37:14','2017-08-05 15:37:14','','post-db-sync-versioning-continuos deploymnet-git','','inherit','open','closed','','post-db-sync-versioning-continuos-deploymnet-git','','','2017-08-05 15:37:14','2017-08-05 15:37:14','',498,'http://www.localhost/fco/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/post-db-sync-versioning-continuos-deploymnet-git.png',0,'attachment','image/png',0),(501,1,'2017-08-08 00:02:07','2017-08-08 00:02:07','','indian-sunset-meditation-1310123','','inherit','open','closed','','indian-sunset-meditation-1310123','','','2017-08-08 00:02:07','2017-08-08 00:02:07','',0,'http://www.localhost/fco/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/indian-sunset-meditation-1310123.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(502,1,'2017-08-08 00:03:28','2017-08-08 00:03:28','','Iguazu Falls_tablet','','inherit','open','closed','','iguazu-falls_tablet','','','2017-08-08 00:03:28','2017-08-08 00:03:28','',0,'http://www.localhost/fco/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Iguazu-Falls_tablet.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(506,1,'2017-08-08 00:12:27','2017-08-08 00:12:27','','coloring-pages-adults-zen-anti-stress-curves-tunels-and-hearts','','inherit','open','closed','','coloring-pages-adults-zen-anti-stress-curves-tunels-and-hearts-2','','','2017-08-08 00:12:27','2017-08-08 00:12:27','',0,'http://www.localhost/fco/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/coloring-pages-adults-zen-anti-stress-curves-tunels-and-hearts-1.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(519,1,'2017-08-09 04:53:20','2017-08-09 04:53:20','<h2>download MySQL</h2>\r\nI went to...\r\n\r\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html\r\n\r\n...and downloaded the largest file (Windows (x86, 32-bit), MSI Installer 5.7.19 378.8M) second one down and just did the normal install.

Communicating your mission and nonprofit goals require careful consideration of the visual factors that will keep users on your site long enough to soak up your message.\r\n\r\nThis article focuses on the five basic tips to helpÂ website buildersÂ of associations and foundations create visually appealing websites. These tips are not new shattering revelations and could apply to almost every site. However, successfully implementing these tips could improve your website, increase its traffic and therefore increase the visibility of your associative activities.\r\n<figure class=\"post-image post-mediaBleed aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1052131 aligncenter lazy lazyLoaded\" src=\"https://cdn2.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/06/5-Tips-to-Make-Your-Website-Attractive.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 511px) 100vw, 511px\" srcset=\"https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/06/5-Tips-to-Make-Your-Website-Attractive.jpg 511w, https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/06/5-Tips-to-Make-Your-Website-Attractive-280x160.jpg 280w, https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/06/5-Tips-to-Make-Your-Website-Attractive-473x270.jpg 473w, https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/06/5-Tips-to-Make-Your-Website-Attractive-236x135.jpg 236w\" alt=\"\" width=\"511\" height=\"292\" data-pin-nopin=\"true\" /></figure>\r\n<h2>1. Create an overload-free home page that encourages exploration.</h2>\r\nA cluttered home page that is overwhelmed with too much text or too many graphics can chase away potential donors. The homepage is often the first impression the user will have to your structure. It should never be designed at random just to have a presence on the web. Network for Good, a not-for-profit organization that provides fundraising ideas for other non-profit organizations, recommends ââ¦ for simplicity and clarity in design. Must be attractive, captivating, but uncluttered. â\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>2. Create recognition of your structure with a logo.</h2>\r\nHaving a logo that strengthens the spirit of your structure or serves as a reminder for the cause helps make a site memorable. Visual identification through a logo is part of the emotional experience that users experience when they come into contact with your organization. The creation of a logo is an investment and must be a budget item with high priority. Ideally, the logo referring to a non-profit organization should be immediately recognizable, evoke and transmit your non-profit or your mission, and remain effective in a variety of colors or presentation modes.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2><strong>3</strong>. Create a coherent graphic chart.</h2>\r\nThe maintenance of recurring visual elements on a website makes it possible to unify the site and make navigation easier. Help establish consistency by choosing colors and fonts that complement the identity of your association or foundation and ensure that they are maintained on all pages. Maintaining this visual coherence on the site and mirroring it in all your other information and communication media will strengthen the identity of your organization. The visual theme should reflect the culture of the organization and at the same time be targeted to attract donors, volunteers, and supporters that you want to reach.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>4. Create an audiovisual presence.</h2>\r\nAÂ compelling videoÂ that tells a story helps to attract the attention of Internet users. Even if your site can exist without the video, this will bring him a definite asset. Creating such a video can be costly if performed professionally. But, it can also be done using a simple camera with a minimum of editing, certainly a look less polished but that will fulfill very well the function sought: tell your missions in pictures. The gain will not be measured solely by the number of visits to the website. A well-made video can extend its usefulness beyond the site itself as a centerpiece of the communication efforts of your nonprofit.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>5. Create an emotional bond by using photographs to tell a story.</h2>\r\nUsing static or rotating photographs helps put faces on volunteers, recipients, and donors. Avoid photographs that could be used elsewhere because your photos need to reinforce your image and not just anyone. Unlike video, still, images allow the user to focus on a specific moment in time, allowing contemplation and creating a lasting link.\r\n<h2>Word from web designers</h2>\r\nExperienced Web designers might recommend not using templates because they can limit flexibility and appear too banal and personal. However, small organizations may consider this solution if their in-house design capability fails or if they cannot afford to outsource web design. Many models are available online in variousÂ content management systemsÂ (CMS), including the very popular WordPress.com. Although itâs not always ideal, starting with a template can provide a basic site that can often be adapted later to further integrate your organizationâs signature.\r\n<h2>The final word</h2>\r\nCreating a visually attractive non-profit site does not necessarily require a significant budget. However, improving your site, if your budget allows it, is a goal that may require expenses. Consider these few tips as a starting point to help you evaluate your existing website and ways that you can use to improve how you tell the story of your nonprofit with attractive visuals.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</article></div>\r\n<aside class=\"sidebar\"><section id=\"most-popular\" class=\"most-popular u-m-2\">&nbsp;\r\n<div class=\"story story--small\" data-event-category=\"Article\" data-event-action=\"Most Popular\" data-event-label=\"Post\" data-event-non-interaction=\"1\"></div>\r\n</section></aside>','5 Tips to Make Your Website Attractive','','publish','open','closed','','5-tips-to-make-your-website-attractive','','','2017-08-14 21:59:32','2017-08-14 21:59:32','',0,'http://www.localhost/fco/?p=578',0,'post','',0),(579,1,'2017-08-10 04:38:31','2017-08-10 04:38:31','','post-5-Tips-to-Make-Your-Website-Attractive-01-796x530','','inherit','open','closed','','post-5-tips-to-make-your-website-attractive-01-796x530','','','2017-08-10 04:38:31','2017-08-10 04:38:31','',578,'http://www.localhost/fco/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/post-5-Tips-to-Make-Your-Website-Attractive-01-796x530.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(615,1,'2017-08-10 07:41:23','2017-08-10 07:41:23','Flower City Online is seeking a full-time Influencer Relations Specialist to join our affectionately named âFlower Power.â Here at the Flower, we value thoughtful and remarkable new business pursuits just as much as our pixels, code and products.

Many businesses find themselves going through a few different website companies / developers before they finally find someone they can trust and rely on.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, the following experiences have seemingly become commonplace for most of the businesses that come to us looking for help:\r\n<h3>Symptons of a Bad Website Project Experience</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Unresponsiveness after money has been received</li>\r\n 	<li>Additional costs that were never communicated</li>\r\n 	<li>Extended or excessive project delays</li>\r\n 	<li>Deliverables that completely missed what was initially communicated</li>\r\n 	<li>Issues that arose only upon project âcompletionâ</li>\r\n 	<li>Important aspects getting left out entirely only to be found after the fact by someone else</li>\r\n 	<li>Reluctance to provide access or clear answers</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWeâre sure you have many more of your own that you could probably add to this list.\r\n\r\nThe good news is that these experiences can be avoided and we want to help you learn how. Itâs one thing to have a bad experience, but itâs another to lose money and time as a result.\r\n\r\nLetâs take a look at what you can do to make your next website development project a great one â specifically if youâre going with WordPress.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignleft img-thumbnail size-full wp-image-4603\" src=\"https://www.imforza.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/question-mark.png\" alt=\"Leave a comment\" width=\"75\" height=\"75\" data-attachment-id=\"4603\" data-permalink=\"https://www.imforza.com/blog/how-to-find-curate-and-create-effective-content/question-mark/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.imforza.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/question-mark.png?fit=75%2C75&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"75,75\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Leave a comment\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.imforza.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/question-mark.png?fit=75%2C75&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.imforza.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/question-mark.png?fit=75%2C75&amp;ssl=1\" />\r\n<h4>Have you had a terrible website project experience?</h4>\r\nIf you need to vent, then we would love to hear about it.

Using an existing theme? A custom theme?</h4>\r\nAlthough this is a more technical question that you may not know the right or wrong answer to, what youâre really looking for here is a clear answer as to why the website is being constructed the way it is.\r\n\r\nThere are really only three options here [with WordPress]:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Using an existing theme (as is)</li>\r\n 	<li>Customizing an existing theme</li>\r\n 	<li>Building a custom theme from scratch</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nLetâs take a look at the pros and cons to each of these options:\r\n\r\n<strong>Using an existing theme (as is)</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>pros</strong>: Inexpensive (most themes cost anywhere from $15 â $75), reasonably quick to setup, typically built for someone with limited technical WordPress experience\r\n<strong>cons</strong>: Extraneous code, limited options for customization, reliance on theme developer for support and updates, same design as many other companies with the same theme\r\n\r\n<strong>Customizing an existing theme or starter theme (as a child theme)</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>pros</strong>: Typically little design work needed, shorter development time\r\n<strong>cons</strong>: Future updates breaking designs and functionality if not coded properly (common), unnecessary code, reliance on multiple developers to support updates\r\n\r\n<strong>Building a custom theme from scratch</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>pros</strong>: Built specifically to meet business objectives, lighter code base (when built correctly), more flexible for customizations\r\n<strong>cons</strong>: More expensive, longer development time\r\n<div class=\"panel panel-warning\">\r\n<div class=\"panel-heading\"><strong>TIP:</strong></div>\r\n<div class=\"panel-body\">Â Donât make your decision on price alone, as many businesses do. Instead figure out whoâs going to be using the site, what resources you have available and what your business objectives are for your new website.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>What access do I get to my website?</h4>\r\n<em>This may be controversial for some companies that sell websites built on proprietary software, but if youâre using WordPress (recommended), then thereâs no exception in our opinion.</em>\r\n\r\nDonât you dare build a new website unless you have full, 100% access and ownership Â of it.\r\n\r\nTo protect your best interests and to give yourself the flexibility you may sometimes need to support and grow your website you must make sure you ask for and get the following:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>WordPress administrative access</li>\r\n 	<li>FTP access</li>\r\n 	<li>Database access</li>\r\n 	<li>DNS settings access</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou most likely will never need these if you find a goodÂ <a title=\"website development and hosting company\" href=\"http://www.imforza.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">website development and hosting company</a>, but you should never have to fight for this information.\r\n<div class=\"panel panel-warning\">\r\n<div class=\"panel-heading\"><strong>TIP:</strong></div>\r\n<div class=\"panel-body\">When you get this information, if youâre not familiar with how to use it, then donât decide to tinker with it and then expect your website company to fix your mistakes. Instead offer to sign a waiver of liability if and when you think you feel like playing with these things. Or, better yet, ask for training or a development environment to learn on instead.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>How will you make it easy for me to manage the content on my website?</h4>\r\nWordPress is one of the most user-friendly content management systems you will come across, but donât assume that this will be the case with your website.\r\n\r\nA poorly built WordPress site can be just as difficult and restricting as an outdated custom, proprietary CMS. If youâre interested in adding, changing and testing different types of Â content throughout your site, then you must make sure your website is built accordingly.\r\n\r\nIf youâre not looking to learnÂ <a title=\"Website Development\" href=\"http://www.imforza.com/services/website-development/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WordPress development</a>Â or becoming accustomed to FTP, then youâre going to want your website to be built so editing defined blocks of content is very easy for you.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, make sure the following things are done:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Homepage content blocks are controlled by Widgets or Pages</li>\r\n 	<li>Navigation menus are controlled by WordPressâ native Menus feature</li>\r\n 	<li>Page layout options are provided as page Templates</li>\r\n 	<li>Sidebars and footers are controlled by WordPressâ Sidebar feature</li>\r\n 	<li>PrimaryÂ <a title=\"Title Tag Optimization\" href=\"http://www.imforza.com/blog/title-tag-optimization/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">on-page SEO elements</a>Â are not hard coded</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<div class=\"panel panel-warning\">\r\n<div class=\"panel-heading\"><strong>TIP:</strong></div>\r\n<div class=\"panel-body\">Before you have any approved web page designs built into WordPress make it very clear to your web developer which sections of content you think you will want / need to be editing regularly.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>What plugins will be included with my initial install / build?</h4>\r\nOne of the biggest advantages to using WordPress for your website is that the community of developers behind it has produced a massiveÂ <a title=\"WordPress Plugins\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">library of plugins</a>Â for webmasters to use. If thereâs a feature you need on your website, then someone has probably already built a plugin for it.\r\n\r\nAs with anything though, plugins need to be used in moderation. And unfortunately a lot of developers continue to overload their websites with an excessive amount of plugins. Donât let your developer make the same mistake.\r\n\r\nIf your developer is going to use plugins, then you want to be sure that each one is absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\nHere are someÂ <a title=\"The ONLY WordPress Plugins You Need\" href=\"http://www.imforza.com/blog/only-wordpress-plugins-you-need/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">plugins that we recommend</a>Â limiting your website to:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Akismet</li>\r\n 	<li>W3 Total Cache (or WP Super Cache)</li>\r\n 	<li>WordPress SEO by Yoast</li>\r\n 	<li>Gravity Forms</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<div class=\"panel panel-warning\">\r\n<div class=\"panel-heading\"><strong>TIP:</strong></div>\r\n<div class=\"panel-body\">Use ourÂ <a title=\"WordPress Plugin Flowchart\" href=\"http://www.imforza.com/blog/only-wordpress-plugins-you-need/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">handy flowchart</a>Â if you or your developer are not sure whether a plugin should be used or whether the particular feature should be built into your theme.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Will my website be mobile-friendly?</h4>\r\nYour website needs to beÂ <a title=\"How to Make a Mobile Friendly Website\" href=\"http://www.imforza.com/blog/how-to-make-a-mobile-friendly-website/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">mobile-friendly</a>. Donât let anyone convince you otherwise.\r\n\r\nAnd the best time to establish your mobile strategy is during the build of your website as the experience you provide to your mobile visitors will dictate how successfully you can market to them in the future.\r\n\r\nThere are a few different ways to make your website mobile-friendly:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Make your website responsive (recommended)</li>\r\n 	<li>Build a mobile website specifically for mobile users</li>\r\n 	<li>Create a mobile application</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<div class=\"panel panel-warning\">\r\n<div class=\"panel-heading\"><strong>TIP:</strong></div>\r\n<div class=\"panel-body\">If youâre building a new website, then donât settle for anything less than a properly built responsive site. If you want to make your existing site mobile-friendly because it is not already responsive, then a mobile website may be a good option for you as it wonât require a rebuild / redesign.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>What will you be doing to preserve my current websiteâs history and SEO value?</h4>\r\nThis may be the most forgotten, under-appreciated question of them all so you need to understand something important hereâ¦\r\n\r\nIf you have an existing website that has been online for awhile, then you MUST do the proper migration work to preserve any history or SEO value that your website may have accumulated over the years.\r\n\r\nIf you or your web developer fail to do this work then you may experience the following:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Drop in organic rankings</li>\r\n 	<li>Broken links from other websites that have linked to you</li>\r\n 	<li>Increase in 404 errors on your site</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<div class=\"panel panel-warning\">\r\n<div class=\"panel-heading\"><strong>TIP:</strong></div>\r\n<div class=\"panel-body\">Your website does not need to be ranking already to needÂ <a title=\"Website Migration Checklist\" href=\"http://www.imforza.com/blog/website-migration-checklist/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">proper migration work</a>. This is a common misconception and usually one that comes from misinformed developers. Do not launch your new website until you have mapped all of your old URLs to your new ones and transferred any previous SEO work and content.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>What SEO features / fundamentals will be included with my website?</h4>\r\nWordPress is already one of the most SEO friendly frameworks to build a website on; however, implementation of SEO work and best practices are still needed for optimal results.\r\n\r\nAny reputable website development company should be familiar with the best ways to setup and optimize WordPress beyond whatâs included with the core code base.\r\n\r\nTo be safe, here are some of the essentials that you will want addressed on your website:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>No canonicalization issues with the main domain</li>\r\n 	<li>Unnecessary archive pages do not get indexed</li>\r\n 	<li>Title and meta descriptions are unique for each page</li>\r\n 	<li>Permalinks are clean and consistent throughout the site</li>\r\n 	<li>Social graph and schema markup are baked in</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<div class=\"panel panel-warning\">\r\n<div class=\"panel-heading\"><strong>TIP:</strong></div>\r\n<div class=\"panel-body\">The best tool for optimizing your WordPress website is, by far, theÂ <a title=\"WordPress SEO Plugin\" href=\"https://yoast.com/wordpress/seo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WordPress SEO plugin from Yoast</a>. Require your developer to install this plugin and ensure it works as it should on your site.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>How will the website convert visitors?</h4>\r\nIf you rely solely on your developer to make sure that your website converts, then youâre going to find yourself pretty disappointed after a few months of little to no results.\r\n\r\nAs the business representative, it is your job to have aÂ <a title=\"6 Key Components of a Conversion Friendly Website\" href=\"http://www.imforza.com/blog/6-key-components-of-a-conversion-friendly-website/\">conversion strategy</a>.\r\n\r\nThis involves knowing and communicating the following to your developer:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Who your audience is (are they local? national? international?)</li>\r\n 	<li>What your USP (<a title=\"Unique Selling Proposition\" href=\"http://www.imforza.com/blog/find-your-why-grow-your-business/\">unique selling proposition</a>) is</li>\r\n 	<li>What your mainÂ <a title=\"How to Pick an Effective Call to Action\" href=\"http://www.imforza.com/blog/how-to-pick-an-effective-call-to-action/\">calls to action</a>Â are</li>\r\n 	<li>What your inboundÂ <a title=\"How to Close Web Leads\" href=\"http://www.imforza.com/blog/how-to-close-web-leads/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">web lead process</a>Â is</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nOnce this information is clearly communicated to your developer, then they should be able to use this information to properly design and develop the proper elements to attract, capture and log conversions for you.\r\n<div class=\"panel panel-warning\">\r\n<div class=\"panel-heading\"><strong>TIP:</strong></div>\r\n<div class=\"panel-body\">A strong, unique, compellingÂ <a title=\"How to Pick an Effective Call to Action\" href=\"http://www.imforza.com/blog/how-to-pick-an-effective-call-to-action/\">call to action</a>Â is vital to the success of your website. If you fail to pinpoint and communicate what this is, then your website will burn through traffic without giving you much of a return.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>How and where will my website be hosted?</h4>\r\nHosting is one of the things that gets undervalued as we have become so accustomed to quick, cheap hosting solutions from companies like GoDaddy.\r\n\r\nThis is unfortunate because how and where your website is hosted is incredibly important for a lot of different reasons.\r\n\r\nHere are just some of the main reasons you want a great hosting solution / provider:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Host location fits the geographic location(s) of your target audience</li>\r\n 	<li>Hosting setup (e.g. database settings, server settings, etc) is properly implemented and prepared depending on your expected traffic</li>\r\n 	<li>Available bandwidth and disk space is tailored to your business to avoid lag time and file upload issues</li>\r\n 	<li>Responsiveness and reliability of your hosting provider can save you a lot of time and stress when things go down (which they can sometimes)</li>\r\n 	<li>Access to your hosting settings (e.g. DNS, MX records, A records, etc) is provided in cases where you need to hire someone else or do something during off-hours</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<div class=\"panel panel-warning\">\r\n<div class=\"panel-heading\"><strong>TIP:</strong></div>\r\n<div class=\"panel-body\">If your website gets hundreds of thousands of visitors per month, then you might want to consider a dedicated hosting environment that you pay a little extra for. If your website is new and relatively small (less than 50k â 100k visitors per month), then a shared hosting solution (e.g.Â <a title=\"Rackspace Cloud Sites\" href=\"https://www.rackspace.com/cloud/sites/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Rackspace Cloud Sites</a>) can be an affordable, reliable solution for most businesses.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>What will you be doing to keep my WordPress site secure?</h4>\r\nThere arenât many downsides to using WordPress, except for this oneâ¦\r\n\r\nWordPress can be vulnerable to being hacked as it is a popular, open-source platform.\r\n\r\nHowever, hacking should never be an issue as long as your developer does the following:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Properly codes the website to prevent easy entrances for hackers</li>\r\n 	<li>Only uses themes and plugins from reputable developers that actively support their code</li>\r\n 	<li>Helps you keep the website updated (i.e. core, theme and plugin updates)</li>\r\n 	<li>Recommends / uses preemptive security tools (e.g.Â <a title=\"CloudFlare\" href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">CloudFlare</a>)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<div class=\"panel panel-warning\">\r\n<div class=\"panel-heading\"><strong>TIP:</strong></div>\r\n<div class=\"panel-body\">Most experienced WordPress developers have had to deal with a hacked WordPress site at some point. These are actually the ones you want to work with, not someone who has no experience in resolving a hack quickly and efficiently. Ask your developer if theyâve ever had to deal with a hacked website and how they resolved it.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Will you be performing WordPress core, theme and plugin updates as they become available?</h4>\r\nOne of the most common oversights we see with businesses that come to us with an existing WordPress website is the failure (by them or their current company) to keep their website properly updated.\r\n\r\nItâs not unusual for us to see the following:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>WordPress version being used is numerous versions behind</li>\r\n 	<li>Theme version being used has never been updated</li>\r\n 	<li>30+ plugins installed with most being out of date or just sitting unused</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese may seem harmless, but just one of the these can hinder the performance of your site and make it vulnerable for anyone that feels like being malicious.\r\n<div class=\"panel panel-warning\">\r\n<div class=\"panel-heading\"><strong>TIP:</strong></div>\r\n<div class=\"panel-body\">Get a clear understanding of who will be responsible for keeping these things updated. If youâre paying a monthly service fee, then your website company really should be. If youâre not paying for some type of service plan, then these responsibilities fall on you.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Will you be keeping backups of my site?</h4>\r\nAlthough this is not 100% necessary we do recommend that every WordPress website come with some type of backup solution.\r\n\r\nYou never know when something can happen to your site or when you might need to restore an old version of your site so having a backed up version to pull from can save you a lot of time and money.\r\n\r\nSome great backup solutions for WordPress sites are:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><a title=\"ManageWP\" href=\"https://managewp.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">ManageWP</a></li>\r\n 	<li><a title=\"Backup Buddy\" href=\"http://ithemes.com/purchase/backupbuddy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Backup Buddy</a></li>\r\n 	<li><a title=\"Infinite WP\" href=\"http://infinitewp.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Infinite WP</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<div class=\"panel panel-warning\">\r\n<div class=\"panel-heading\"><strong>TIP:</strong></div>\r\n<div class=\"panel-body\">If youâre not changing / adding content to your website very often (shame on you), then a weekly or monthly backup is more than suffice. Opt for daily or hourly backups though if youâre really active on your website (and pat yourself on the back while youâre at it).</div>\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>How easy will it be to add features / functionality to my website in the future?</h4>\r\nIf youâre expecting to get results from your website, then you need to plan to keep optimizing it in the future. Many times this involves adding different types of content, but also various features or functionality that helps visitors convert.\r\n\r\nTo accomplish these things and to maintain a good relationship with your web developer you want to find out â upfront â how easy this process will be and how much it may or may not cost you.\r\n\r\nHere are some things that you may want or need done after launch that youâll need clarification on:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Adding / changing / removing plugins</li>\r\n 	<li>Changing themes</li>\r\n 	<li>Adding page templates (e.g. landing pages)</li>\r\n 	<li>Adding e-Commerce functionality</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<div class=\"panel panel-warning\">\r\n<div class=\"panel-heading\"><strong>TIP:</strong></div>\r\n<div class=\"panel-body\">Donât expect these things to be included unless youâve opted into some type of monthly service / support plan with your developer that includes some allotted time for this technical support.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>What will be used to help me track my website traffic?</h4>\r\nOne of the most frustrating things we come across when a company brings their current website to us for review, redesign or rebuild is when they have no type of tracking in place.\r\n\r\nGetting an analytics program setup on site launch needs to become an industry-wide standard as itâs nearly impossible to optimize a website without any type of data to work with.\r\n\r\nTo improve your website you need to have constant access to data on the following metrics (at the very least):\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Traffic (visitors, traffic sources)</li>\r\n 	<li>Usability (site performance, bounce rate)</li>\r\n 	<li>Engagement (top content)</li>\r\n 	<li>Conversion (conversion rate, top conversion funnels)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSome free tools that we highly recommend are:Â <a title=\"Google Analytics\" href=\"https://www.google.com/analytics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Google Analytics</a>,Â <a title=\"Google Webmaster Tools\" href=\"http://www.google.com/webmaster\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Google Webmaster Tools</a>Â andÂ <a title=\"Bing Webmaster Tools\" href=\"https://www.bing.com/toolbox/webmaster\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Bing Webmaster Tools</a>\r\n<div class=\"panel panel-warning\">\r\n<div class=\"panel-heading\"><strong>TIP:</strong></div>\r\n<div class=\"panel-body\">Donât settle for just setup of an analytics program. Make sure that you get proper conversion / goal tracking setup so that you can get data on one of your most important metrics â conversion rate.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>How do I request help if I need something and is this included in what I am paying for?</h4>\r\nIf youâre the type of customer that doesnât have the time or patience to find answers and solutions to your own questions, then you are going to need some clarification on how to get support after launch.\r\n\r\nTo prevent frustration from having your questions and issues go unanswered make sure you understand how to get support.\r\n\r\nHere are some questions youâll want to get answers to:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>What is the quickest way to get a response on a question?</li>\r\n 	<li>What hours can I expect you to be available for support?</li>\r\n 	<li>What type of response time can I expect?</li>\r\n 	<li>Do you have a knowledgebase online that I can reference if youâre unavailable?</li>\r\n 	<li>How much technical support is included with my monthly fee? Does this not cover any certain types of support?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<div class=\"panel panel-warning\">\r\n<div class=\"panel-heading\"><strong>TIP:</strong></div>\r\n<div class=\"panel-body\">Try to respect the support system your developer has in place (e.g.Â <a title=\"imFORZA Support System\" href=\"http://www.imforza.com/support/get-support/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">online ticket system</a>) as youâll typically get the best response this way. If your development company decides to go MIA on you when you have an issue though, then try calling their sales line instead of their support line. Most sales departments donât like missing inbound phone calls.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Are there any additional fees outside of what I have paid / am paying?</h4>\r\nNo one likes to be ânickel and dimedâ especially after spending a considerable amount on a new website.\r\n\r\nThat said, if you donât get a clear understanding of what exactly is included with the website youâre paying for, then you are going to leave a lot of room for your developer to want / need to charge you for more work.\r\n\r\nSome surefire ways to mitigate âafter the factâ costs is to ask for, understand, acknowledge and agree to the following:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Detailed project scope of the entire project (e.g. elements, requirements, hours, costs)</li>\r\n 	<li>Terms and conditions (e.g. if you decide to go MIA donât expect your developer to get right back on your project)</li>\r\n 	<li>Sitemap</li>\r\n 	<li>Assumptions</li>\r\n 	<li>Expectations</li>\r\n 	<li>Payment terms</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<div class=\"panel panel-warning\">\r\n<div class=\"panel-heading\"><strong>TIP:</strong></div>\r\n<div class=\"panel-body\">Spend the extra time planning out your project with your developer before starting / paying for the design and development work. In addition, be prepared to pay for anything outside of what you originally agreed upon and adjust your timeline expectations accordingly.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n<h3><strong>BONUS OFFER</strong></h3>\r\n<img class=\"alignnone img-thumbnail size-full wp-image-5543\" src=\"https://www.imforza.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/questionnaire.png\" alt=\"Website Development Questionnaire\" width=\"192\" height=\"235\" data-attachment-id=\"5543\" data-permalink=\"https://www.imforza.com/blog/questions-to-ask-your-wordpress-developer/questionnaire/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.imforza.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/questionnaire.png?fit=192%2C235&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"192,235\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Website Development Questionnaire\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.imforza.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/questionnaire.png?fit=192%2C235&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.imforza.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/questionnaire.png?fit=192%2C235&amp;ssl=1\" />\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-md-8\">\r\n\r\nTo make it even easier for you to get answers to these important questions from your WordPress developer we have created aÂ <strong>WORDPRESS DEVELOPMENT QUESTIONNAIRE</strong>Â and we want to give it to you forÂ <strong>FREE</strong>.All you have to do isÂ <a title=\"Bonus Offer\" href=\"https://www.imforza.com/tools/wordpress-development-questionnaire/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">request the document here</a>.

Many businesses find themselves going through a few different website companies / developers before they finally find someone they can trust and rely on.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, the following experiences have seemingly become commonplace for most of the businesses that come to us looking for help:\r\n<h3>Symptons of a Bad Website Project Experience</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Unresponsiveness after money has been received</li>\r\n 	<li>Additional costs that were never communicated</li>\r\n 	<li>Extended or excessive project delays</li>\r\n 	<li>Deliverables that completely missed what was initially communicated</li>\r\n 	<li>Issues that arose only upon project âcompletionâ</li>\r\n 	<li>Important aspects getting left out entirely only to be found after the fact by someone else</li>\r\n 	<li>Reluctance to provide access or clear answers</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWeâre sure you have many more of your own that you could probably add to this list.\r\n\r\nThe good news is that these experiences can be avoided and we want to help you learn how.

Using an existing theme? A custom theme?</h4>\r\nAlthough this is a more technical question that you may not know the right or wrong answer to, what youâre really looking for here is a clear answer as to why the website is being constructed the way it is.\r\n\r\nThere are really only three options here [with WordPress]:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Using an existing theme (as is)</li>\r\n 	<li>Customizing an existing theme</li>\r\n 	<li>Building a custom theme from scratch</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nLetâs take a look at the pros and cons to each of these options:\r\n\r\n<strong>Using an existing theme (as is)</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>pros</strong>: Inexpensive (most themes cost anywhere from $15 â $75), reasonably quick to setup, typically built for someone with limited technical WordPress experience\r\n<strong>cons</strong>: Extraneous code, limited options for customization, reliance on theme developer for support and updates, same design as many other companies with the same theme\r\n\r\n<strong>Customizing an existing theme or starter theme (as a child theme)</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>pros</strong>: Typically little design work needed, shorter development time\r\n<strong>cons</strong>: Future updates breaking designs and functionality if not coded properly (common), unnecessary code, reliance on multiple developers to support updates\r\n\r\n<strong>Building a custom theme from scratch</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>pros</strong>: Built specifically to meet business objectives, lighter code base (when built correctly), more flexible for customizations\r\n<strong>cons</strong>: More expensive, longer development time\r\n<div class=\"panel panel-warning\">\r\n<div class=\"panel-heading\"><strong>TIP:</strong></div>\r\n<div class=\"panel-body\">Â Donât make your decision on price alone, as many businesses do. Instead figure out whoâs going to be using the site, what resources you have available and what your business objectives are for your new website.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>What access do I get to my website?</h4>\r\n<em>This may be controversial for some companies that sell websites built on proprietary software, but if youâre using WordPress (recommended), then thereâs no exception in our opinion.</em>\r\n\r\nDonât you dare build a new website unless you have full, 100% access and ownership Â of it.\r\n\r\nTo protect your best interests and to give yourself the flexibility you may sometimes need to support and grow your website you must make sure you ask for and get the following:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>WordPress administrative access</li>\r\n 	<li>FTP access</li>\r\n 	<li>Database access</li>\r\n 	<li>DNS settings access</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou most likely will never need these if you find a goodÂ <a title=\"website development and hosting company\" href=\"http://www.imforza.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">website development and hosting company</a>, but you should never have to fight for this information.\r\n<div class=\"panel panel-warning\">\r\n<div class=\"panel-heading\"><strong>TIP:</strong></div>\r\n<div class=\"panel-body\">When you get this information, if youâre not familiar with how to use it, then donât decide to tinker with it and then expect your website company to fix your mistakes. Instead offer to sign a waiver of liability if and when you think you feel like playing with these things. Or, better yet, ask for training or a development environment to learn on instead.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>How will you make it easy for me to manage the content on my website?</h4>\r\nWordPress is one of the most user-friendly content management systems you will come across, but donât assume that this will be the case with your website.\r\n\r\nA poorly built WordPress site can be just as difficult and restricting as an outdated custom, proprietary CMS. If youâre interested in adding, changing and testing different types of Â content throughout your site, then you must make sure your website is built accordingly.\r\n\r\nIf youâre not looking to learnÂ <a title=\"Website Development\" href=\"http://www.imforza.com/services/website-development/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WordPress development</a>Â or becoming accustomed to FTP, then youâre going to want your website to be built so editing defined blocks of content is very easy for you.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, make sure the following things are done:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Homepage content blocks are controlled by Widgets or Pages</li>\r\n 	<li>Navigation menus are controlled by WordPressâ native Menus feature</li>\r\n 	<li>Page layout options are provided as page Templates</li>\r\n 	<li>Sidebars and footers are controlled by WordPressâ Sidebar feature</li>\r\n 	<li>PrimaryÂ <a title=\"Title Tag Optimization\" href=\"http://www.imforza.com/blog/title-tag-optimization/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">on-page SEO elements</a>Â are not hard coded</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<div class=\"panel panel-warning\">\r\n<div class=\"panel-heading\"><strong>TIP:</strong></div>\r\n<div class=\"panel-body\">Before you have any approved web page designs built into WordPress make it very clear to your web developer which sections of content you think you will want / need to be editing regularly.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>What plugins will be included with my initial install / build?</h4>\r\nOne of the biggest advantages to using WordPress for your website is that the community of developers behind it has produced a massiveÂ <a title=\"WordPress Plugins\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">library of plugins</a>Â for webmasters to use. If thereâs a feature you need on your website, then someone has probably already built a plugin for it.\r\n\r\nAs with anything though, plugins need to be used in moderation. And unfortunately a lot of developers continue to overload their websites with an excessive amount of plugins. Donât let your developer make the same mistake.\r\n\r\nIf your developer is going to use plugins, then you want to be sure that each one is absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\nHere are someÂ <a title=\"The ONLY WordPress Plugins You Need\" href=\"http://www.imforza.com/blog/only-wordpress-plugins-you-need/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">plugins that we recommend</a>Â limiting your website to:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Akismet</li>\r\n 	<li>W3 Total Cache (or WP Super Cache)</li>\r\n 	<li>WordPress SEO by Yoast</li>\r\n 	<li>Gravity Forms</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<div class=\"panel panel-warning\">\r\n<div class=\"panel-heading\"><strong>TIP:</strong></div>\r\n<div class=\"panel-body\">Use ourÂ <a title=\"WordPress Plugin Flowchart\" href=\"http://www.imforza.com/blog/only-wordpress-plugins-you-need/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">handy flowchart</a>Â if you or your developer are not sure whether a plugin should be used or whether the particular feature should be built into your theme.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Will my website be mobile-friendly?</h4>\r\nYour website needs to beÂ <a title=\"How to Make a Mobile Friendly Website\" href=\"http://www.imforza.com/blog/how-to-make-a-mobile-friendly-website/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">mobile-friendly</a>. Donât let anyone convince you otherwise.\r\n\r\nAnd the best time to establish your mobile strategy is during the build of your website as the experience you provide to your mobile visitors will dictate how successfully you can market to them in the future.\r\n\r\nThere are a few different ways to make your website mobile-friendly:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Make your website responsive (recommended)</li>\r\n 	<li>Build a mobile website specifically for mobile users</li>\r\n 	<li>Create a mobile application</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<div class=\"panel panel-warning\">\r\n<div class=\"panel-heading\"><strong>TIP:</strong></div>\r\n<div class=\"panel-body\">If youâre building a new website, then donât settle for anything less than a properly built responsive site. If you want to make your existing site mobile-friendly because it is not already responsive, then a mobile website may be a good option for you as it wonât require a rebuild / redesign.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>What will you be doing to preserve my current websiteâs history and SEO value?</h4>\r\nThis may be the most forgotten, under-appreciated question of them all so you need to understand something important hereâ¦\r\n\r\nIf you have an existing website that has been online for awhile, then you MUST do the proper migration work to preserve any history or SEO value that your website may have accumulated over the years.\r\n\r\nIf you or your web developer fail to do this work then you may experience the following:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Drop in organic rankings</li>\r\n 	<li>Broken links from other websites that have linked to you</li>\r\n 	<li>Increase in 404 errors on your site</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<div class=\"panel panel-warning\">\r\n<div class=\"panel-heading\"><strong>TIP:</strong></div>\r\n<div class=\"panel-body\">Your website does not need to be ranking already to needÂ <a title=\"Website Migration Checklist\" href=\"http://www.imforza.com/blog/website-migration-checklist/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">proper migration work</a>. This is a common misconception and usually one that comes from misinformed developers. Do not launch your new website until you have mapped all of your old URLs to your new ones and transferred any previous SEO work and content.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>What SEO features / fundamentals will be included with my website?</h4>\r\nWordPress is already one of the most SEO friendly frameworks to build a website on; however, implementation of SEO work and best practices are still needed for optimal results.\r\n\r\nAny reputable website development company should be familiar with the best ways to setup and optimize WordPress beyond whatâs included with the core code base.\r\n\r\nTo be safe, here are some of the essentials that you will want addressed on your website:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>No canonicalization issues with the main domain</li>\r\n 	<li>Unnecessary archive pages do not get indexed</li>\r\n 	<li>Title and meta descriptions are unique for each page</li>\r\n 	<li>Permalinks are clean and consistent throughout the site</li>\r\n 	<li>Social graph and schema markup are baked in</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<div class=\"panel panel-warning\">\r\n<div class=\"panel-heading\"><strong>TIP:</strong></div>\r\n<div class=\"panel-body\">The best tool for optimizing your WordPress website is, by far, theÂ <a title=\"WordPress SEO Plugin\" href=\"https://yoast.com/wordpress/seo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WordPress SEO plugin from Yoast</a>. Require your developer to install this plugin and ensure it works as it should on your site.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>How will the website convert visitors?</h4>\r\nIf you rely solely on your developer to make sure that your website converts, then youâre going to find yourself pretty disappointed after a few months of little to no results.\r\n\r\nAs the business representative, it is your job to have aÂ <a title=\"6 Key Components of a Conversion Friendly Website\" href=\"http://www.imforza.com/blog/6-key-components-of-a-conversion-friendly-website/\">conversion strategy</a>.\r\n\r\nThis involves knowing and communicating the following to your developer:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Who your audience is (are they local? national? international?)</li>\r\n 	<li>What your USP (<a title=\"Unique Selling Proposition\" href=\"http://www.imforza.com/blog/find-your-why-grow-your-business/\">unique selling proposition</a>) is</li>\r\n 	<li>What your mainÂ <a title=\"How to Pick an Effective Call to Action\" href=\"http://www.imforza.com/blog/how-to-pick-an-effective-call-to-action/\">calls to action</a>Â are</li>\r\n 	<li>What your inboundÂ <a title=\"How to Close Web Leads\" href=\"http://www.imforza.com/blog/how-to-close-web-leads/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">web lead process</a>Â is</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nOnce this information is clearly communicated to your developer, then they should be able to use this information to properly design and develop the proper elements to attract, capture and log conversions for you.\r\n<div class=\"panel panel-warning\">\r\n<div class=\"panel-heading\"><strong>TIP:</strong></div>\r\n<div class=\"panel-body\">A strong, unique, compellingÂ <a title=\"How to Pick an Effective Call to Action\" href=\"http://www.imforza.com/blog/how-to-pick-an-effective-call-to-action/\">call to action</a>Â is vital to the success of your website. If you fail to pinpoint and communicate what this is, then your website will burn through traffic without giving you much of a return.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>How and where will my website be hosted?</h4>\r\nHosting is one of the things that gets undervalued as we have become so accustomed to quick, cheap hosting solutions from companies like GoDaddy.\r\n\r\nThis is unfortunate because how and where your website is hosted is incredibly important for a lot of different reasons.\r\n\r\nHere are just some of the main reasons you want a great hosting solution / provider:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Host location fits the geographic location(s) of your target audience</li>\r\n 	<li>Hosting setup (e.g. database settings, server settings, etc) is properly implemented and prepared depending on your expected traffic</li>\r\n 	<li>Available bandwidth and disk space is tailored to your business to avoid lag time and file upload issues</li>\r\n 	<li>Responsiveness and reliability of your hosting provider can save you a lot of time and stress when things go down (which they can sometimes)</li>\r\n 	<li>Access to your hosting settings (e.g. DNS, MX records, A records, etc) is provided in cases where you need to hire someone else or do something during off-hours</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<div class=\"panel panel-warning\">\r\n<div class=\"panel-heading\"><strong>TIP:</strong></div>\r\n<div class=\"panel-body\">If your website gets hundreds of thousands of visitors per month, then you might want to consider a dedicated hosting environment that you pay a little extra for. If your website is new and relatively small (less than 50k â 100k visitors per month), then a shared hosting solution (e.g.Â <a title=\"Rackspace Cloud Sites\" href=\"https://www.rackspace.com/cloud/sites/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Rackspace Cloud Sites</a>) can be an affordable, reliable solution for most businesses.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>What will you be doing to keep my WordPress site secure?</h4>\r\nThere arenât many downsides to using WordPress, except for this oneâ¦\r\n\r\nWordPress can be vulnerable to being hacked as it is a popular, open-source platform.\r\n\r\nHowever, hacking should never be an issue as long as your developer does the following:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Properly codes the website to prevent easy entrances for hackers</li>\r\n 	<li>Only uses themes and plugins from reputable developers that actively support their code</li>\r\n 	<li>Helps you keep the website updated (i.e. core, theme and plugin updates)</li>\r\n 	<li>Recommends / uses preemptive security tools (e.g.Â <a title=\"CloudFlare\" href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">CloudFlare</a>)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<div class=\"panel panel-warning\">\r\n<div class=\"panel-heading\"><strong>TIP:</strong></div>\r\n<div class=\"panel-body\">Most experienced WordPress developers have had to deal with a hacked WordPress site at some point. These are actually the ones you want to work with, not someone who has no experience in resolving a hack quickly and efficiently. Ask your developer if theyâve ever had to deal with a hacked website and how they resolved it.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Will you be performing WordPress core, theme and plugin updates as they become available?</h4>\r\nOne of the most common oversights we see with businesses that come to us with an existing WordPress website is the failure (by them or their current company) to keep their website properly updated.\r\n\r\nItâs not unusual for us to see the following:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>WordPress version being used is numerous versions behind</li>\r\n 	<li>Theme version being used has never been updated</li>\r\n 	<li>30+ plugins installed with most being out of date or just sitting unused</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese may seem harmless, but just one of the these can hinder the performance of your site and make it vulnerable for anyone that feels like being malicious.\r\n<div class=\"panel panel-warning\">\r\n<div class=\"panel-heading\"><strong>TIP:</strong></div>\r\n<div class=\"panel-body\">Get a clear understanding of who will be responsible for keeping these things updated. If youâre paying a monthly service fee, then your website company really should be. If youâre not paying for some type of service plan, then these responsibilities fall on you.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Will you be keeping backups of my site?</h4>\r\nAlthough this is not 100% necessary we do recommend that every WordPress website come with some type of backup solution.\r\n\r\nYou never know when something can happen to your site or when you might need to restore an old version of your site so having a backed up version to pull from can save you a lot of time and money.\r\n\r\nSome great backup solutions for WordPress sites are:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><a title=\"ManageWP\" href=\"https://managewp.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">ManageWP</a></li>\r\n 	<li><a title=\"Backup Buddy\" href=\"http://ithemes.com/purchase/backupbuddy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Backup Buddy</a></li>\r\n 	<li><a title=\"Infinite WP\" href=\"http://infinitewp.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Infinite WP</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<div class=\"panel panel-warning\">\r\n<div class=\"panel-heading\"><strong>TIP:</strong></div>\r\n<div class=\"panel-body\">If youâre not changing / adding content to your website very often (shame on you), then a weekly or monthly backup is more than suffice. Opt for daily or hourly backups though if youâre really active on your website (and pat yourself on the back while youâre at it).</div>\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>How easy will it be to add features / functionality to my website in the future?</h4>\r\nIf youâre expecting to get results from your website, then you need to plan to keep optimizing it in the future. Many times this involves adding different types of content, but also various features or functionality that helps visitors convert.\r\n\r\nTo accomplish these things and to maintain a good relationship with your web developer you want to find out â upfront â how easy this process will be and how much it may or may not cost you.\r\n\r\nHere are some things that you may want or need done after launch that youâll need clarification on:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Adding / changing / removing plugins</li>\r\n 	<li>Changing themes</li>\r\n 	<li>Adding page templates (e.g. landing pages)</li>\r\n 	<li>Adding e-Commerce functionality</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<div class=\"panel panel-warning\">\r\n<div class=\"panel-heading\"><strong>TIP:</strong></div>\r\n<div class=\"panel-body\">Donât expect these things to be included unless youâve opted into some type of monthly service / support plan with your developer that includes some allotted time for this technical support.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>What will be used to help me track my website traffic?</h4>\r\nOne of the most frustrating things we come across when a company brings their current website to us for review, redesign or rebuild is when they have no type of tracking in place.\r\n\r\nGetting an analytics program setup on site launch needs to become an industry-wide standard as itâs nearly impossible to optimize a website without any type of data to work with.\r\n\r\nTo improve your website you need to have constant access to data on the following metrics (at the very least):\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Traffic (visitors, traffic sources)</li>\r\n 	<li>Usability (site performance, bounce rate)</li>\r\n 	<li>Engagement (top content)</li>\r\n 	<li>Conversion (conversion rate, top conversion funnels)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSome free tools that we highly recommend are:Â <a title=\"Google Analytics\" href=\"https://www.google.com/analytics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Google Analytics</a>,Â <a title=\"Google Webmaster Tools\" href=\"http://www.google.com/webmaster\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Google Webmaster Tools</a>Â andÂ <a title=\"Bing Webmaster Tools\" href=\"https://www.bing.com/toolbox/webmaster\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Bing Webmaster Tools</a>\r\n<div class=\"panel panel-warning\">\r\n<div class=\"panel-heading\"><strong>TIP:</strong></div>\r\n<div class=\"panel-body\">Donât settle for just setup of an analytics program. Make sure that you get proper conversion / goal tracking setup so that you can get data on one of your most important metrics â conversion rate.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>How do I request help if I need something and is this included in what I am paying for?</h4>\r\nIf youâre the type of customer that doesnât have the time or patience to find answers and solutions to your own questions, then you are going to need some clarification on how to get support after launch.\r\n\r\nTo prevent frustration from having your questions and issues go unanswered make sure you understand how to get support.\r\n\r\nHere are some questions youâll want to get answers to:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>What is the quickest way to get a response on a question?</li>\r\n 	<li>What hours can I expect you to be available for support?</li>\r\n 	<li>What type of response time can I expect?</li>\r\n 	<li>Do you have a knowledgebase online that I can reference if youâre unavailable?</li>\r\n 	<li>How much technical support is included with my monthly fee? Does this not cover any certain types of support?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<div class=\"panel panel-warning\">\r\n<div class=\"panel-heading\"><strong>TIP:</strong></div>\r\n<div class=\"panel-body\">Try to respect the support system your developer has in place (e.g.Â <a title=\"imFORZA Support System\" href=\"http://www.imforza.com/support/get-support/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">online ticket system</a>) as youâll typically get the best response this way. If your development company decides to go MIA on you when you have an issue though, then try calling their sales line instead of their support line. Most sales departments donât like missing inbound phone calls.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Are there any additional fees outside of what I have paid / am paying?</h4>\r\nNo one likes to be ânickel and dimedâ especially after spending a considerable amount on a new website.\r\n\r\nThat said, if you donât get a clear understanding of what exactly is included with the website youâre paying for, then you are going to leave a lot of room for your developer to want / need to charge you for more work.\r\n\r\nSome surefire ways to mitigate âafter the factâ costs is to ask for, understand, acknowledge and agree to the following:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Detailed project scope of the entire project (e.g. elements, requirements, hours, costs)</li>\r\n 	<li>Terms and conditions (e.g. if you decide to go MIA donât expect your developer to get right back on your project)</li>\r\n 	<li>Sitemap</li>\r\n 	<li>Assumptions</li>\r\n 	<li>Expectations</li>\r\n 	<li>Payment terms</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<div class=\"panel panel-warning\">\r\n<div class=\"panel-heading\"><strong>TIP:</strong></div>\r\n<div class=\"panel-body\">Spend the extra time planning out your project with your developer before starting / paying for the design and development work. In addition, be prepared to pay for anything outside of what you originally agreed upon and adjust your timeline expectations accordingly.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n<h3><strong>BONUS OFFER</strong></h3>\r\n<img class=\"alignnone img-thumbnail size-full wp-image-5543\" src=\"https://www.imforza.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/questionnaire.png\" alt=\"Website Development Questionnaire\" width=\"192\" height=\"235\" data-attachment-id=\"5543\" data-permalink=\"https://www.imforza.com/blog/questions-to-ask-your-wordpress-developer/questionnaire/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.imforza.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/questionnaire.png?fit=192%2C235&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"192,235\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Website Development Questionnaire\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.imforza.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/questionnaire.png?fit=192%2C235&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.imforza.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/questionnaire.png?fit=192%2C235&amp;ssl=1\" />\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-md-8\">To make it even easier for you to get answers to these important questions from your WordPress developer we have created aÂ <strong>WORDPRESS DEVELOPMENT QUESTIONNAIRE</strong>Â and we want to give it to you forÂ <strong>FREE</strong>.All you have to do isÂ <a title=\"Bonus Offer\" href=\"https://www.imforza.com/tools/wordpress-development-questionnaire/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">request the document here</a>.

Many businesses find themselves going through a few different website companies / developers before they finally find someone they can trust and rely on.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, the following experiences have seemingly become commonplace for most of the businesses that come to us looking for help:\r\n<h3>Symptons of a Bad Website Project Experience</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Unresponsiveness after money has been received</li>\r\n 	<li>Additional costs that were never communicated</li>\r\n 	<li>Extended or excessive project delays</li>\r\n 	<li>Deliverables that completely missed what was initially communicated</li>\r\n 	<li>Issues that arose only upon project âcompletionâ</li>\r\n 	<li>Important aspects getting left out entirely only to be found after the fact by someone else</li>\r\n 	<li>Reluctance to provide access or clear answers</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWeâre sure you have many more of your own that you could probably add to this list.\r\n\r\nThe good news is that these experiences can be avoided and we want to help you learn how.

Using an existing theme? A custom theme?</h4>\r\nAlthough this is a more technical question that you may not know the right or wrong answer to, what youâre really looking for here is a clear answer as to why the website is being constructed the way it is.\r\n\r\nThere are really only three options here [with WordPress]:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Using an existing theme (as is)</li>\r\n 	<li>Customizing an existing theme</li>\r\n 	<li>Building a custom theme from scratch</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nLetâs take a look at the pros and cons to each of these options:\r\n\r\n<strong>Using an existing theme (as is)</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>pros</strong>: Inexpensive (most themes cost anywhere from $15 â $75), reasonably quick to setup, typically built for someone with limited technical WordPress experience\r\n<strong>cons</strong>: Extraneous code, limited options for customization, reliance on theme developer for support and updates, same design as many other companies with the same theme\r\n\r\n<strong>Customizing an existing theme or starter theme (as a child theme)</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>pros</strong>: Typically little design work needed, shorter development time\r\n<strong>cons</strong>: Future updates breaking designs and functionality if not coded properly (common), unnecessary code, reliance on multiple developers to support updates\r\n\r\n<strong>Building a custom theme from scratch</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>pros</strong>: Built specifically to meet business objectives, lighter code base (when built correctly), more flexible for customizations\r\n<strong>cons</strong>: More expensive, longer development time\r\n<div class=\"panel panel-warning\">\r\n<div class=\"panel-heading\"><strong>TIP:</strong></div>\r\n<div class=\"panel-body\">Â Donât make your decision on price alone, as many businesses do. Instead figure out whoâs going to be using the site, what resources you have available and what your business objectives are for your new website.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>What access do I get to my website?</h4>\r\n<em>This may be controversial for some companies that sell websites built on proprietary software, but if youâre using WordPress (recommended), then thereâs no exception in our opinion.</em>\r\n\r\nDonât you dare build a new website unless you have full, 100% access and ownership Â of it.\r\n\r\nTo protect your best interests and to give yourself the flexibility you may sometimes need to support and grow your website you must make sure you ask for and get the following:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>WordPress administrative access</li>\r\n 	<li>FTP access</li>\r\n 	<li>Database access</li>\r\n 	<li>DNS settings access</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou most likely will never need these if you find a goodÂ <a title=\"website development and hosting company\" href=\"http://www.imforza.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">website development and hosting company</a>, but you should never have to fight for this information.\r\n<div class=\"panel panel-warning\">\r\n<div class=\"panel-heading\"><strong>TIP:</strong></div>\r\n<div class=\"panel-body\">When you get this information, if youâre not familiar with how to use it, then donât decide to tinker with it and then expect your website company to fix your mistakes. Instead offer to sign a waiver of liability if and when you think you feel like playing with these things. Or, better yet, ask for training or a development environment to learn on instead.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>How will you make it easy for me to manage the content on my website?</h4>\r\nWordPress is one of the most user-friendly content management systems you will come across, but donât assume that this will be the case with your website.\r\n\r\nA poorly built WordPress site can be just as difficult and restricting as an outdated custom, proprietary CMS. If youâre interested in adding, changing and testing different types of Â content throughout your site, then you must make sure your website is built accordingly.\r\n\r\nIf youâre not looking to learnÂ <a title=\"Website Development\" href=\"http://www.imforza.com/services/website-development/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WordPress development</a>Â or becoming accustomed to FTP, then youâre going to want your website to be built so editing defined blocks of content is very easy for you.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, make sure the following things are done:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Homepage content blocks are controlled by Widgets or Pages</li>\r\n 	<li>Navigation menus are controlled by WordPressâ native Menus feature</li>\r\n 	<li>Page layout options are provided as page Templates</li>\r\n 	<li>Sidebars and footers are controlled by WordPressâ Sidebar feature</li>\r\n 	<li>PrimaryÂ <a title=\"Title Tag Optimization\" href=\"http://www.imforza.com/blog/title-tag-optimization/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">on-page SEO elements</a>Â are not hard coded</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<div class=\"panel panel-warning\">\r\n<div class=\"panel-heading\"><strong>TIP:</strong></div>\r\n<div class=\"panel-body\">Before you have any approved web page designs built into WordPress make it very clear to your web developer which sections of content you think you will want / need to be editing regularly.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>What plugins will be included with my initial install / build?</h4>\r\nOne of the biggest advantages to using WordPress for your website is that the community of developers behind it has produced a massiveÂ <a title=\"WordPress Plugins\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">library of plugins</a>Â for webmasters to use. If thereâs a feature you need on your website, then someone has probably already built a plugin for it.\r\n\r\nAs with anything though, plugins need to be used in moderation. And unfortunately a lot of developers continue to overload their websites with an excessive amount of plugins. Donât let your developer make the same mistake.\r\n\r\nIf your developer is going to use plugins, then you want to be sure that each one is absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\nHere are someÂ <a title=\"The ONLY WordPress Plugins You Need\" href=\"http://www.imforza.com/blog/only-wordpress-plugins-you-need/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">plugins that we recommend</a>Â limiting your website to:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Akismet</li>\r\n 	<li>W3 Total Cache (or WP Super Cache)</li>\r\n 	<li>WordPress SEO by Yoast</li>\r\n 	<li>Gravity Forms</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<div class=\"panel panel-warning\">\r\n<div class=\"panel-heading\"><strong>TIP:</strong></div>\r\n<div class=\"panel-body\">Use ourÂ <a title=\"WordPress Plugin Flowchart\" href=\"http://www.imforza.com/blog/only-wordpress-plugins-you-need/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">handy flowchart</a>Â if you or your developer are not sure whether a plugin should be used or whether the particular feature should be built into your theme.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Will my website be mobile-friendly?</h4>\r\nYour website needs to beÂ <a title=\"How to Make a Mobile Friendly Website\" href=\"http://www.imforza.com/blog/how-to-make-a-mobile-friendly-website/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">mobile-friendly</a>. Donât let anyone convince you otherwise.\r\n\r\nAnd the best time to establish your mobile strategy is during the build of your website as the experience you provide to your mobile visitors will dictate how successfully you can market to them in the future.\r\n\r\nThere are a few different ways to make your website mobile-friendly:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Make your website responsive (recommended)</li>\r\n 	<li>Build a mobile website specifically for mobile users</li>\r\n 	<li>Create a mobile application</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<div class=\"panel panel-warning\">\r\n<div class=\"panel-heading\"><strong>TIP:</strong></div>\r\n<div class=\"panel-body\">If youâre building a new website, then donât settle for anything less than a properly built responsive site. If you want to make your existing site mobile-friendly because it is not already responsive, then a mobile website may be a good option for you as it wonât require a rebuild / redesign.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>What will you be doing to preserve my current websiteâs history and SEO value?</h4>\r\nThis may be the most forgotten, under-appreciated question of them all so you need to understand something important hereâ¦\r\n\r\nIf you have an existing website that has been online for awhile, then you MUST do the proper migration work to preserve any history or SEO value that your website may have accumulated over the years.\r\n\r\nIf you or your web developer fail to do this work then you may experience the following:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Drop in organic rankings</li>\r\n 	<li>Broken links from other websites that have linked to you</li>\r\n 	<li>Increase in 404 errors on your site</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<div class=\"panel panel-warning\">\r\n<div class=\"panel-heading\"><strong>TIP:</strong></div>\r\n<div class=\"panel-body\">Your website does not need to be ranking already to needÂ <a title=\"Website Migration Checklist\" href=\"http://www.imforza.com/blog/website-migration-checklist/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">proper migration work</a>. This is a common misconception and usually one that comes from misinformed developers. Do not launch your new website until you have mapped all of your old URLs to your new ones and transferred any previous SEO work and content.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>What SEO features / fundamentals will be included with my website?</h4>\r\nWordPress is already one of the most SEO friendly frameworks to build a website on; however, implementation of SEO work and best practices are still needed for optimal results.\r\n\r\nAny reputable website development company should be familiar with the best ways to setup and optimize WordPress beyond whatâs included with the core code base.\r\n\r\nTo be safe, here are some of the essentials that you will want addressed on your website:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>No canonicalization issues with the main domain</li>\r\n 	<li>Unnecessary archive pages do not get indexed</li>\r\n 	<li>Title and meta descriptions are unique for each page</li>\r\n 	<li>Permalinks are clean and consistent throughout the site</li>\r\n 	<li>Social graph and schema markup are baked in</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<div class=\"panel panel-warning\">\r\n<div class=\"panel-heading\"><strong>TIP:</strong></div>\r\n<div class=\"panel-body\">The best tool for optimizing your WordPress website is, by far, theÂ <a title=\"WordPress SEO Plugin\" href=\"https://yoast.com/wordpress/seo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WordPress SEO plugin from Yoast</a>. Require your developer to install this plugin and ensure it works as it should on your site.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>How will the website convert visitors?</h4>\r\nIf you rely solely on your developer to make sure that your website converts, then youâre going to find yourself pretty disappointed after a few months of little to no results.\r\n\r\nAs the business representative, it is your job to have aÂ <a title=\"6 Key Components of a Conversion Friendly Website\" href=\"http://www.imforza.com/blog/6-key-components-of-a-conversion-friendly-website/\">conversion strategy</a>.\r\n\r\nThis involves knowing and communicating the following to your developer:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Who your audience is (are they local? national? international?)</li>\r\n 	<li>What your USP (<a title=\"Unique Selling Proposition\" href=\"http://www.imforza.com/blog/find-your-why-grow-your-business/\">unique selling proposition</a>) is</li>\r\n 	<li>What your mainÂ <a title=\"How to Pick an Effective Call to Action\" href=\"http://www.imforza.com/blog/how-to-pick-an-effective-call-to-action/\">calls to action</a>Â are</li>\r\n 	<li>What your inboundÂ <a title=\"How to Close Web Leads\" href=\"http://www.imforza.com/blog/how-to-close-web-leads/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">web lead process</a>Â is</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nOnce this information is clearly communicated to your developer, then they should be able to use this information to properly design and develop the proper elements to attract, capture and log conversions for you.\r\n<div class=\"panel panel-warning\">\r\n<div class=\"panel-heading\"><strong>TIP:</strong></div>\r\n<div class=\"panel-body\">A strong, unique, compellingÂ <a title=\"How to Pick an Effective Call to Action\" href=\"http://www.imforza.com/blog/how-to-pick-an-effective-call-to-action/\">call to action</a>Â is vital to the success of your website. If you fail to pinpoint and communicate what this is, then your website will burn through traffic without giving you much of a return.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>How and where will my website be hosted?</h4>\r\nHosting is one of the things that gets undervalued as we have become so accustomed to quick, cheap hosting solutions from companies like GoDaddy.\r\n\r\nThis is unfortunate because how and where your website is hosted is incredibly important for a lot of different reasons.\r\n\r\nHere are just some of the main reasons you want a great hosting solution / provider:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Host location fits the geographic location(s) of your target audience</li>\r\n 	<li>Hosting setup (e.g. database settings, server settings, etc) is properly implemented and prepared depending on your expected traffic</li>\r\n 	<li>Available bandwidth and disk space is tailored to your business to avoid lag time and file upload issues</li>\r\n 	<li>Responsiveness and reliability of your hosting provider can save you a lot of time and stress when things go down (which they can sometimes)</li>\r\n 	<li>Access to your hosting settings (e.g. DNS, MX records, A records, etc) is provided in cases where you need to hire someone else or do something during off-hours</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<div class=\"panel panel-warning\">\r\n<div class=\"panel-heading\"><strong>TIP:</strong></div>\r\n<div class=\"panel-body\">If your website gets hundreds of thousands of visitors per month, then you might want to consider a dedicated hosting environment that you pay a little extra for. If your website is new and relatively small (less than 50k â 100k visitors per month), then a shared hosting solution (e.g.Â <a title=\"Rackspace Cloud Sites\" href=\"https://www.rackspace.com/cloud/sites/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Rackspace Cloud Sites</a>) can be an affordable, reliable solution for most businesses.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>What will you be doing to keep my WordPress site secure?</h4>\r\nThere arenât many downsides to using WordPress, except for this oneâ¦\r\n\r\nWordPress can be vulnerable to being hacked as it is a popular, open-source platform.\r\n\r\nHowever, hacking should never be an issue as long as your developer does the following:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Properly codes the website to prevent easy entrances for hackers</li>\r\n 	<li>Only uses themes and plugins from reputable developers that actively support their code</li>\r\n 	<li>Helps you keep the website updated (i.e. core, theme and plugin updates)</li>\r\n 	<li>Recommends / uses preemptive security tools (e.g.Â <a title=\"CloudFlare\" href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">CloudFlare</a>)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<div class=\"panel panel-warning\">\r\n<div class=\"panel-heading\"><strong>TIP:</strong></div>\r\n<div class=\"panel-body\">Most experienced WordPress developers have had to deal with a hacked WordPress site at some point. These are actually the ones you want to work with, not someone who has no experience in resolving a hack quickly and efficiently. Ask your developer if theyâve ever had to deal with a hacked website and how they resolved it.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Will you be performing WordPress core, theme and plugin updates as they become available?</h4>\r\nOne of the most common oversights we see with businesses that come to us with an existing WordPress website is the failure (by them or their current company) to keep their website properly updated.\r\n\r\nItâs not unusual for us to see the following:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>WordPress version being used is numerous versions behind</li>\r\n 	<li>Theme version being used has never been updated</li>\r\n 	<li>30+ plugins installed with most being out of date or just sitting unused</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese may seem harmless, but just one of the these can hinder the performance of your site and make it vulnerable for anyone that feels like being malicious.\r\n<div class=\"panel panel-warning\">\r\n<div class=\"panel-heading\"><strong>TIP:</strong></div>\r\n<div class=\"panel-body\">Get a clear understanding of who will be responsible for keeping these things updated. If youâre paying a monthly service fee, then your website company really should be. If youâre not paying for some type of service plan, then these responsibilities fall on you.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Will you be keeping backups of my site?</h4>\r\nAlthough this is not 100% necessary we do recommend that every WordPress website come with some type of backup solution.\r\n\r\nYou never know when something can happen to your site or when you might need to restore an old version of your site so having a backed up version to pull from can save you a lot of time and money.\r\n\r\nSome great backup solutions for WordPress sites are:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><a title=\"ManageWP\" href=\"https://managewp.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">ManageWP</a></li>\r\n 	<li><a title=\"Backup Buddy\" href=\"http://ithemes.com/purchase/backupbuddy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Backup Buddy</a></li>\r\n 	<li><a title=\"Infinite WP\" href=\"http://infinitewp.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Infinite WP</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<div class=\"panel panel-warning\">\r\n<div class=\"panel-heading\"><strong>TIP:</strong></div>\r\n<div class=\"panel-body\">If youâre not changing / adding content to your website very often (shame on you), then a weekly or monthly backup is more than suffice. Opt for daily or hourly backups though if youâre really active on your website (and pat yourself on the back while youâre at it).</div>\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>How easy will it be to add features / functionality to my website in the future?</h4>\r\nIf youâre expecting to get results from your website, then you need to plan to keep optimizing it in the future. Many times this involves adding different types of content, but also various features or functionality that helps visitors convert.\r\n\r\nTo accomplish these things and to maintain a good relationship with your web developer you want to find out â upfront â how easy this process will be and how much it may or may not cost you.\r\n\r\nHere are some things that you may want or need done after launch that youâll need clarification on:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Adding / changing / removing plugins</li>\r\n 	<li>Changing themes</li>\r\n 	<li>Adding page templates (e.g. landing pages)</li>\r\n 	<li>Adding e-Commerce functionality</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<div class=\"panel panel-warning\">\r\n<div class=\"panel-heading\"><strong>TIP:</strong></div>\r\n<div class=\"panel-body\">Donât expect these things to be included unless youâve opted into some type of monthly service / support plan with your developer that includes some allotted time for this technical support.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>What will be used to help me track my website traffic?</h4>\r\nOne of the most frustrating things we come across when a company brings their current website to us for review, redesign or rebuild is when they have no type of tracking in place.\r\n\r\nGetting an analytics program setup on site launch needs to become an industry-wide standard as itâs nearly impossible to optimize a website without any type of data to work with.\r\n\r\nTo improve your website you need to have constant access to data on the following metrics (at the very least):\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Traffic (visitors, traffic sources)</li>\r\n 	<li>Usability (site performance, bounce rate)</li>\r\n 	<li>Engagement (top content)</li>\r\n 	<li>Conversion (conversion rate, top conversion funnels)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSome free tools that we highly recommend are:Â <a title=\"Google Analytics\" href=\"https://www.google.com/analytics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Google Analytics</a>,Â <a title=\"Google Webmaster Tools\" href=\"http://www.google.com/webmaster\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Google Webmaster Tools</a>Â andÂ <a title=\"Bing Webmaster Tools\" href=\"https://www.bing.com/toolbox/webmaster\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Bing Webmaster Tools</a>\r\n<div class=\"panel panel-warning\">\r\n<div class=\"panel-heading\"><strong>TIP:</strong></div>\r\n<div class=\"panel-body\">Donât settle for just setup of an analytics program. Make sure that you get proper conversion / goal tracking setup so that you can get data on one of your most important metrics â conversion rate.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>How do I request help if I need something and is this included in what I am paying for?</h4>\r\nIf youâre the type of customer that doesnât have the time or patience to find answers and solutions to your own questions, then you are going to need some clarification on how to get support after launch.\r\n\r\nTo prevent frustration from having your questions and issues go unanswered make sure you understand how to get support.\r\n\r\nHere are some questions youâll want to get answers to:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>What is the quickest way to get a response on a question?</li>\r\n 	<li>What hours can I expect you to be available for support?</li>\r\n 	<li>What type of response time can I expect?</li>\r\n 	<li>Do you have a knowledgebase online that I can reference if youâre unavailable?</li>\r\n 	<li>How much technical support is included with my monthly fee? Does this not cover any certain types of support?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<div class=\"panel panel-warning\">\r\n<div class=\"panel-heading\"><strong>TIP:</strong></div>\r\n<div class=\"panel-body\">Try to respect the support system your developer has in place (e.g.Â <a title=\"imFORZA Support System\" href=\"http://www.imforza.com/support/get-support/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">online ticket system</a>) as youâll typically get the best response this way. If your development company decides to go MIA on you when you have an issue though, then try calling their sales line instead of their support line. Most sales departments donât like missing inbound phone calls.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Are there any additional fees outside of what I have paid / am paying?</h4>\r\nNo one likes to be ânickel and dimedâ especially after spending a considerable amount on a new website.\r\n\r\nThat said, if you donât get a clear understanding of what exactly is included with the website youâre paying for, then you are going to leave a lot of room for your developer to want / need to charge you for more work.\r\n\r\nSome surefire ways to mitigate âafter the factâ costs is to ask for, understand, acknowledge and agree to the following:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Detailed project scope of the entire project (e.g. elements, requirements, hours, costs)</li>\r\n 	<li>Terms and conditions (e.g. if you decide to go MIA donât expect your developer to get right back on your project)</li>\r\n 	<li>Sitemap</li>\r\n 	<li>Assumptions</li>\r\n 	<li>Expectations</li>\r\n 	<li>Payment terms</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<div class=\"panel panel-warning\">\r\n<div class=\"panel-heading\"><strong>TIP:</strong></div>\r\n<div class=\"panel-body\">Spend the extra time planning out your project with your developer before starting / paying for the design and development work. In addition, be prepared to pay for anything outside of what you originally agreed upon and adjust your timeline expectations accordingly.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n<h3><strong>BONUS OFFER</strong></h3>\r\n<img class=\"alignnone img-thumbnail size-full wp-image-5543\" src=\"https://www.imforza.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/questionnaire.png\" alt=\"Website Development Questionnaire\" width=\"192\" height=\"235\" data-attachment-id=\"5543\" data-permalink=\"https://www.imforza.com/blog/questions-to-ask-your-wordpress-developer/questionnaire/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.imforza.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/questionnaire.png?fit=192%2C235&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"192,235\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Website Development Questionnaire\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.imforza.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/questionnaire.png?fit=192%2C235&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.imforza.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/questionnaire.png?fit=192%2C235&amp;ssl=1\" />\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-md-8\">\r\n\r\nTo make it even easier for you to get answers to these important questions from your WordPress developer we have created aÂ <strong>WORDPRESS DEVELOPMENT QUESTIONNAIRE</strong>Â and we want to give it to you forÂ <strong>FREE</strong>.All you have to do isÂ <a title=\"Bonus Offer\" href=\"https://www.imforza.com/tools/wordpress-development-questionnaire/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">request the document here</a>.
